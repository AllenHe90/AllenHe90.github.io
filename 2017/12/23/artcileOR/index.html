<p>Supply function equilibrium models are used to study electricity market auctions with uncertain demand. We study the effects on the supply function equilibrium of a tax, levied by the system operator, on the observed surplus of producers. Such a tax provides an incentive for producers to alter their offers to avoid the tax. We consider these incentives under both strategic and price-taking assumptions. The model is extended to a setting in which producers are taxed on the benefits accruing to them from a transmission line expansion (a beneficiaries-pay transmission charge). In this setting, we show how this tax may lead to lower prices in equilibrium.<br>Keywords: supply function equilibrium; energy policies; auctions</p>

<p>Robust Product Line Design<br>Dimitris Bertsimas<br>Sloan School of Management and Operations Research Center, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139<br>Velibor V. Mišić<br>Anderson School of Management, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California 90095<br>Accepted Online: September 18, 2014<br>Received Online: June 2, 2016<br>Published Online: November 03, 2016<br>Operations Research, Volume 65 Issue 1, January-February 2017, pp. 19-37</p>
<p>The majority of approaches to product line design that have been proposed by marketing scientists assume that the underlying choice model that describes how the customer population will respond to a new product line is known precisely. In reality, however, marketers do not precisely know how the customer population will respond and can only obtain an estimate of the choice model from limited conjoint data. In this paper, we propose a new type of optimization approach for product line design under uncertainty. Our approach is based on the paradigm of robust optimization where, rather than optimizing the expected revenue with respect to a single model, one optimizes the worst-case expected revenue with respect to an uncertainty set of models. This framework allows us to account for parameter uncertainty, when we may be confident about the type of model structure but not about the values of the parameters, and structural uncertainty, when we may not even be confident about the right model structure to use to describe the customer population. Through computational experiments with a real conjoint data set, we demonstrate the benefits of our approach in addressing parameter and structural uncertainty. With regard to parameter uncertainty, we show that product lines designed without accounting for parameter uncertainty are fragile and can experience worst-case revenue losses as high as 23%, and that the robust product line can significantly outperform the nominal product line in the worst case, with relative improvements of up to 14%. With regard to structural uncertainty, we similarly show that product lines that are designed for a single model structure can be highly suboptimal under other structures (worst-case losses of up to 37%), while a product line that optimizes against the worst of a set of structurally distinct models can outperform single model product lines by as much as 55% in the worst case and can guarantee good aggregate performance over structurally distinct models.<br>Keywords: product line design; robust optimization; parameter uncertainty; structural uncertainty; model uncertainty</p>

<p>Optimizing Performance-Based Internet Advertisement Campaigns<br>Radha Mookerjee<br>Naveen Jindal School of Management, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, Texas 75080<br>Subodha Kumar<br>Mays Business School, Texas A&amp;M University, College Station, Texas 77843<br>Vijay S.

<p>This study provides an approach to manage an ongoing Internet ad campaign that substantially improves the number of clicks and the revenue earned from clicks. The problem we study is faced by an Internet advertising firm (Chitika) that operates in the Boston area. Chitika contracts with publishers to place relevant advertisements (ads) over a specified period on publisher websites. Ad revenue accrues to the firm and the publisher only if a visitor clicks on an ad (i.e., we are considering the cost-per-click model in this study). This might imply that all visitors to the publisher’s website be shown ads. However, this is not the case if the publisher imposes a click-through-rate constraint on the advertising firm. This performance constraint captures the publisher’s desire to limit ad clutter on the website and hold the advertising firm responsible for the publisher’s opportunity cost of showing an ad that did not result in a click. We develop a predictive model of a visitor clicking on a given ad. Using this prediction of the probability of a click, we develop a decision model that uses a threshold to decide whether or not to show an ad to the visitor. The decision model’s objective is to maximize the advertising firm’s revenue subject to a click-through-rate constraint. A key contribution of this paper is to characterize the structure of the optimal solution. We study and contrast two competing solutions: (1) a static solution, and (2) a rolling-horizon solution that resolves the problem at certain points in the planning horizon. The static solution is shown to be optimal when accurate information on the input parameters to the problem is known. However, when the parameters to the model can only be estimated with some error, the rolling-horizon solution can perform better than the static solution. When using the rolling-horizon solution, it becomes important to choose the appropriate resolving frequency. The implemented models operate in real time in Chitika’s advertising network. Implementation challenges and the business impact of our solution are discussed. To present a head-to-head comparison of our implemented approach with the past practice at Chitika, we implemented our solution in parallel to the past practice.<br>Keywords: Internet advertising; performance constraints; visitor profiling; revenue optimization</p>

<p>Cross-Selling Investment Products with a Win-Win Perspective in Portfolio Optimization<br>Özden Gür Ali<br>College of Administrative Sciences and Economics, Koç University, Rumeli Feneri Yolu, 34450 Istanbul, Turkey<br>Yalçın Akçay<br>College of Administrative Sciences and Economics, Koç University, Rumeli Feneri Yolu, 34450 Istanbul, Turkey<br>Serdar Sayman<br>College of Administrative Sciences and Economics, Koç University, Rumeli Feneri Yolu, 34450 Istanbul, Turkey<br>Emrah Yılmaz<br>College of Administrative Sciences and Economics, Koç University, Rumeli Feneri Yolu, 34450 Istanbul, Turkey<br>M.

<p>We propose a novel approach to cross-selling investment products that considers both the customers’ and the bank’s interests. Our goal is to improve the risk–return profile of the customer’s portfolio and the bank’s profitability concurrently, essentially creating a win-win situation, while deepening the relationship with an acceptable product. Our cross-selling approach takes the customer’s status quo bias into account by starting from the existing customer portfolio, rather than forming an efficient portfolio from scratch. We estimate a customer’s probability of accepting a product offer with a predictive model using readily available data. Then, we model the investment product cross-selling problem as a nonlinear mixed-integer program that maximizes a customer’s expected return from the proposed portfolio, while ensuring that the bank’s profitability improves by a certain factor. We implemented our methodology at the private banking division of Yapı Kredi, the fourth-largest private bank in Turkey. Empirical results from this application illustrate that (1) a traditional mean-variance portfolio optimization approach does not increase portfolio returns and reduces overall bank profits, (2) a standard cross-selling approach increases bank profits at the expense of the customers’ portfolio returns, and (3) our win-win approach increases the expected portfolio returns of customers without increasing their variances, while simultaneously improving bank profits substantially.<br>Keywords: portfolio optimization; cross selling; acceptance probability; predictive model; private banking</p>

<p>We explore the procurement of influenza vaccines by a government whose objective is to minimize the expected social costs (including vaccine, vaccine administration, and influenza treatment costs) when a for-profit vaccine supplier has production yield uncertainty, private information about its productivity (adverse selection), and potentially unverifiable production effort (moral hazard). Timeliness is important—costs for both the supplier and the government procurer may increase if part of the vaccine order is delivered after a scheduled delivery date. We theoretically derive the optimal menu of output-based contracts. Next, we present a menu that is optimal within a more restricted set of practically implementable contracts, and numerically show that such a menu leads to near-optimal outcomes. Finally, we present a novel way to eliminate that information rent if the manufacturer’s effort is also verifiable, a counterintuitive result because the manufacturer has private productivity information. This provides an upper bound for the government on how much it should spend to monitor the manufacturer’s effort.<br>Keywords: mechanism design; principal-agent modeling; adverse selection; moral hazard; epidemiology; influenza vaccine supply chain</p>

<p>We consider the dynamic casino gambling model initially proposed by Barberis (2012) and study the optimal stopping strategy of a precommitting gambler with cumulative prospect theory (CPT) preferences. We illustrate how the strategies computed in Barberis (2012) [Barberis N (2012) A model of casino gambling. Management Sci. 58(1): 35–51.] can be strictly improved by reviewing the betting history or by tossing an independent coin, and we explain that the improvement generated by using randomized strategies results from the lack of quasi-convexity of CPT preferences. Moreover, we show that any path-dependent strategy is equivalent to a randomization of path-independent strategies.<br>Keywords: casino gambling; cumulative prospect theory; path dependence; randomized strategies; quasi-convexity; optimal stopping</p>

<p>Intertemporal Pricing Under Minimax Regret<br>René Caldentey<br>Booth School of Business, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60637<br>Ying Liu<br>Stern School of Business, New York University, New York, New York 10012<br>Ilan Lobel<br>Stern School of Business, New York University, New York, New York 10012<br>Accepted Online: November 19, 2013<br>Received Online: June 21, 2016<br>Published Online: November 07, 2016<br>Operations Research, Volume 65 Issue 1, January-February 2017, pp. 104-129</p>
<p>We consider the pricing problem faced by a monopolist who sells a product to a population of consumers over a finite time horizon. Customers’ types differ along two dimensions: (i) their willingness-to-pay for the product and (ii) their arrival time during the selling season. We assume that the seller knows only the support of the customers’ valuations and do not make any other distributional assumptions about customers’ willingness-to-pay or arrival times. We consider a robust formulation of the seller’s pricing problem that is based on the minimization of her worst-case regret. We consider two distinct cases of customers’ purchasing behavior: myopic and strategic customers. For both of these cases, we characterize optimal price paths. For myopic customers, the regret is determined by the price at a critical time. Depending on the problem parameters, this critical time will be either the end of the selling season or it will be a time that equalizes the worst-case regret generated by undercharging customers and the worst-case regret generated by customers waiting for the price to fall. The optimal pricing strategy is not unique except at the critical time. For strategic consumers, we develop a robust mechanism design approach to compute an optimal policy. Depending on the problem parameters, the optimal policy might lead some consumers to wait until the end of the selling season and might price others out of the market. Under strategic customers, the optimal price equalizes the regrets generated by different customer types that arrive at the beginning of the selling season. We show that a seller that does not know if the customers are myopic should price as if they are strategic. We also show there is no benefit under myopic consumers to having a selling season longer than a certain uniform bound, but that the same is not true with strategic consumers.<br>Keywords: demand uncertainty; strategic consumers; robust optimization; prior-free; worst-case regret</p>

<p>We study the mechanism design problem for a seller of an indivisible good in a setting where privately informed buyers can acquire additional information and refine their valuations for the good at a cost. For this setting, we propose optimal (revenue-maximizing) and efficient (welfare-maximizing) mechanisms that induce a right level of investment in information acquisition. We show that because information is costly, in the optimal and even the efficient mechanisms, not all buyers would obtain the additional information. In fact, these mechanisms incentivize buyers with higher initial valuations to acquire information.<br>Keywords: mechanism design; auctions; online advertising</p>

<p>Capacity Investment with Demand Learning<br>Anyan Qi<br>Naveen Jindal School of Management, The University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, Texas 75080<br>Hyun-Soo Ahn<br>Stephen M. Ross School of Business, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109<br>Amitabh Sinha<br>Stephen M.

<p>We study a firm’s optimal strategy to adjust its capacity using demand information. The capacity adjustment is costly and often subject to managerial hurdles, which sometimes make it difficult to adjust capacity multiple times. To clearly analyze the impact of demand learning on the firm’s decision, we study two scenarios. In the first scenario, the firm’s capacity adjustment cost increases significantly with respect to the number of adjustments because of significant managerial hurdles, and resultantly the firm has a single opportunity to adjust capacity (single adjustment scenario). In the second scenario, the capacity adjustment cost does not change with respect to the number of adjustments because of little managerial hurdles, and therefore the firm has multiple opportunities to adjust capacity (multiple adjustment scenario). For both scenarios, we first formulate the problem as a stochastic dynamic program, and then characterize the firm’s optimal policy: when to adjust and by how much. We show that the optimal decision on when and by how much to change the capacity is not monotone in the likelihood of high demand in the single adjustment scenario, while the optimal decision is monotone under mild conditions, and the optimal policy is a control band policy in the multiple adjustment scenario. The sharp contrast reflects the impact of demand learning on the firm’s optimal capacity decision. Since computing and implementing the optimal policy is not tractable for general problems, we develop a data-driven heuristic for each scenario. In the single adjustment scenario, we show that a two-step heuristic, which explores demand for an appropriately chosen length of time and adjusts the capacity based on the observed demand is asymptotically optimal, and show the convergence rate. In the multiple adjustment scenario, we also show that a multistep heuristic under which the firm adjusts its capacity at a predetermined set of periods with an exponentially increasing gap between two consecutive decisions is asymptotically optimal and shows its convergence rate. We finally apply our heuristics to a numerical study and demonstrate the performance and robustness of the heuristics.<br>The online appendix is available at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2016.1561" target="_blank" rel="external">https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2016.1561</a>.<br>Keywords: capacity management; managerial hurdles; exploration-exploitation; Bayesian updating; data driven</p>

<p>Fare Evasion in Transit Networks<br>José Correa<br>Departamento de Ingeniería Industrial, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile<br>Tobias Harks<br>Institut für Mathematik, Universität Augsburg, 86159 Augsburg, Germany<br>Vincent J.

<p>Public transit systems in major urban areas usually operate under deficits and therefore require significant subsidies. An important cause of this deficit, particularly in the developing world, is the high fare evasion rate mainly due to an ineffective control policy or the lack of it. In this paper we study new models for optimizing fare inspection strategies in transit networks based on bilevel programming. In the first level, the leader (the network operator) determines probabilities for inspecting passengers at different locations, while in the second level, the followers (the fare-evading passengers) respond by optimizing their routes given the inspection probabilities and travel times. To model the followers’ behavior we study both a nonadaptive variant, in which passengers select a path a priori and continue along it throughout their journey, and an adaptive variant, in which they gain information along the way and use it to update their route. For these problems, which are interesting in their own right, we design exact and approximation algorithms, and we prove a tight bound of 3/4 on the ratio of the optimal cost between adaptive and nonadaptive strategies. For the leader’s optimization problem, we study a fixed-fare and a flexible-fare variant, where ticket prices may or may not be set at the operator’s will. For the latter variant, we design an LP-based approximation algorithm. Finally, employing a local search procedure that shifts inspection probabilities within an initially determined support set, we perform an extensive computational study for all variants of the problem on instances of the Dutch railway and the Amsterdam subway network. This study reveals that our solutions are within 5% of theoretical upper bounds drawn from the LP relaxation. We also derive exact nonlinear programming formulations for all variants of the leader’s problem and use them to obtain exact solutions for small instance sizes.<br>The e-companion is available at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2016.1560" target="_blank" rel="external">https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2016.1560</a>.<br>Keywords: transit networks; bilevel optimization</p>

<p>The Travelers Route Choice Problem Under Uncertainty: Dominance Relations Between Strategies<br>Marie Schmidt<br>Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University Rotterdam, NL-3000 DR, Rotterdam, The Netherlands<br>Leo Kroon<br>Deceased, formerly at Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University<br>Anita Schöbel<br>Institute for Numerical and Applied Mathematics, Georg-August University, D-37083, Göttingen, Germany<br>Paul Bouman<br>Econometric Institute, Erasmus University Rotterdam, NL-3000 DR, Rotterdam, The Netherlands<br>Accepted Online: May 13, 2015<br>Received Online: August 5, 2016<br>Published Online: January 06, 2017<br>Operations Research, Volume 65 Issue 1, January-February 2017, pp. 184-199</p>
<p>In this paper we describe the Traveler’s Route Choice Problem (TRCP). This is the problem of a traveler in a railway system who plans to take the fastest route to a destination but is faced with a disruption of unknown length on this route. In that case, he can wait until the disruption is over or take a detour route as an alternative. Since the duration of the disruption is not known in advance, he is left with a decision problem under uncertainty. In this paper we model the problem and describe the strategies that may be used in such a situation. Instead of finding optimal strategies for a specialized quality measure, we consider dominance relations between strategies and show that dominated strategies are nonoptimal for the common quality measures. We then analyze which strategies for the TRCP are dominated. In general, the set of nondominated strategies is strongly reduced. We also show that, under certain assumptions, only a small set of strategies is nondominated and conclude that in this case the TRCP can be solved by enumeration for any of the quality measures.<br>The e-companion is available at <a href="https://doi.org/10.128/opre.2016.1564" target="_blank" rel="external">https://doi.org/10.128/opre.2016.1564</a>.<br>Keywords: public transport; disruption; uncertainty; strategies; dominance</p>

<p>Percentage and Relative Error Measures in Forecast Evaluation<br>Victor Richmond R. Jose<br>McDonough School of Business, Georgetown University, Washington, DC 20057<br>Accepted Online: September 1, 2014<br>Received Online: June 21, 2016<br>Published Online: November 17, 2016<br>Operations Research, Volume 65 Issue 1, January-February 2017, pp. 200-211</p>
<p>Properties of two large families of scale-free forecast accuracy measures that include popular measures such as mean absolute percentage error, relative error, and squared percentage error, are examined in this paper. We describe the optimal reports when forecasts are evaluated using these measures. We also provide analytic expressions for the optimal Bayes’ act associated with these measures under a general power transformation for several well-known probability distributions. We then show that using measures from these two families may inadvertently provide incentives for either pessimism or optimism among forecasters, i.e., rewarding underforecasts or overforecasts relative to some reference measure of central tendency. As an illustration of these concepts, we examine the use of these measures for model selection in a forecast aggregation example using stock price forecasts derived from the Thomson Reuters Institutional Brokers’ Estimate System. This example illustrates how aggregation methods that always yield lower estimates relative to the mean or median generally exhibit better scores using percentage error-based measures, while those that yield higher estimates compared to the mean or median will effectively rank higher when relative error-based measures are used.<br>Keywords: forecast evaluation; forecast accuracy; scale-free measures; scale-independence; pessimism; optimism</p>

<p>0/1 Polytopes with Quadratic Chvátal Rank<br>Thomas Rothvoß<br>University of Washington, Seattle, 98105<br>Laura Sanità<br>University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, N2L 3G1, Canada<br>Accepted Online: August 26, 2014<br>Received Online: May 26, 2016<br>Published Online: December 16, 2016<br>Operations Research, Volume 65 Issue 1, January-February 2017, pp. 212-220</p>
<p>For a polytope P, the Chvátal closure P′ ⊆ P is obtained by simultaneously strengthening all feasible inequalities cx ⩽ β (with integral c) to cx ⩽ ⌊β⌋. The number of iterations of this procedure that are needed until the integral hull of P is reached is called the Chvátal rank. If P ⊆ [0, 1]n, then it is known that O(n2 log n) iterations always suffice and at least (1 + 1/e − o(1))n iterations are sometimes needed, leaving a huge gap between lower and upper bounds.<br>We prove that there is a polytope contained in the 0/1 cube that has Chvátal rank Ω(n2), closing the gap up to a logarithmic factor. In fact, even a superlinear lower bound was mentioned as an open problem by several authors. Our choice of P is the convex hull of a semi-random Knapsack polytope and a single fractional vertex. The main technical ingredient is linking the Chvátal rank to simultaneous Diophantine approximations w.r.t. the ‖·‖1-norm of the normal vector defining P.<br>Keywords: integer programming; Chvátal-gomory cuts</p>

<p>We develop a framework for determining the optimal resource capacity of each station composing a stochastic network, motivated by applications arising in computer capacity planning and business process management. The problem is mathematically intractable in general and therefore one typically resorts to either simplistic analytical approximations or time-consuming simulation-based optimization methods. Our solution framework includes an iterative methodology that relies only on the capability of observing the queue lengths at all network stations for a given resource capacity allocation. We theoretically investigate this proposed methodology for single-class Brownian tree networks and illustrate the use of our framework and the quality of its results through computational experiments.<br>Keywords: capacity allocation; capacity planning; queueing networks; resource capacity management; stochastic networks; stochastic approximation; simulation optimization</p>

<p>Impact of Delay Announcements in Call Centers: An Empirical Approach<br>Zeynep Akşin<br>College of Administrative Sciences and Economics, Koç University, 34450 Sariyer-Istanbul, Turkey<br>Baris Ata<br>Booth School of Business, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60637<br>Seyed Morteza Emadi<br>Kenan-Flagler Business School, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27599<br>Che-Lin Su<br>Formerly at the Booth School of Business, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois<br>Accepted Online: October 11, 2012<br>Received Online: May 20, 2016<br>Published Online: October 27, 2016<br>Operations Research, Volume 65 Issue 1, January-February 2017, pp. 242-265</p>
<p>We undertake an empirical study of the impact of delay announcements on callers’ abandonment behavior and the performance of a call center with two priority classes. A Cox regression analysis reveals that in this call center, callers’ abandonment behavior is affected by the announcement messages heard. To account for this, we formulate a structural estimation model of callers’ (endogenous) abandonment decisions. In this model, callers are forward-looking utility maximizers and make their abandonment decisions by solving an optimal stopping problem. Each caller receives a reward from service and incurs a linear cost of waiting. The reward and per-period waiting cost constitute the structural parameters that we estimate from the data of callers’ abandonment decisions as well as the announcement messages heard. The call center performance is modeled by a Markovian approximation. The main methodological contribution is the definition of an equilibrium in steady state as one where callers’ expectation of their waiting time, which affects their (rational) abandonment behavior, matches their actual waiting time in the call center, as well as the characterization of such an equilibrium as the solution of a set of nonlinear equations. A counterfactual analysis shows that callers react to longer delay announcements by abandoning earlier, that less patient callers as characterized by their reward and cost parameters react more to delay announcements, and that congestion in the call center at the time of the call affects caller reactions to delay announcements.<br>Keywords: delay announcement; abandonment; structural estimation; equilibrium</p>

<p>Rank Centrality: Ranking from Pairwise Comparisons<br>Sahand Negahban<br>Department of Statistics, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut 06510<br>Sewoong Oh<br>Department of Industrial and Enterprise Systems Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, Urbana, Illinois 61801<br>Devavrat Shah<br>Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139<br>Accepted Online: January 15, 2014<br>Received Online: May 6, 2016<br>Published Online: October 18, 2016<br>Operations Research, Volume 65 Issue 1, January-February 2017, pp. 266-287</p>
<p>The question of aggregating pairwise comparisons to obtain a global ranking over a collection of objects has been of interest for a very long time: be it ranking of online gamers (e.g., MSR’s TrueSkill system) and chess players, aggregating social opinions, or deciding which product to sell based on transactions. In most settings, in addition to obtaining a ranking, finding ‘scores’ for each object (e.g., player’s rating) is of interest for understanding the intensity of the preferences.<br>In this paper, we propose RANK CENTRALITY, an iterative rank aggregation algorithm for discovering scores for objects (or items) from pairwise comparisons. The algorithm has a natural random walk interpretation over the graph of objects with an edge present between a pair of objects if they are compared; the score, which we call Rank Centrality, of an object turns out to be its stationary probability under this random walk.<br>To study the efficacy of the algorithm, we consider the popular Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model (equivalent to the Multinomial Logit (MNL) for pairwise comparisons) in which each object has an associated score that determines the probabilistic outcomes of pairwise comparisons between objects. In terms of the pairwise marginal probabilities, which is the main subject of this paper, the MNL model and the BTL model are identical. We bound the finite sample error rates between the scores assumed by the BTL model and those estimated by our algorithm. In particular, the number of samples required to learn the score well with high probability depends on the structure of the comparison graph. When the Laplacian of the comparison graph has a strictly positive spectral gap, e.g., each item is compared to a subset of randomly chosen items, this leads to dependence on the number of samples that is nearly order optimal.<br>Experimental evaluations on synthetic data sets generated according to the BTL model show that our algorithm performs as well as the maximum likelihood estimator for that model and outperforms other popular ranking algorithms.<br>Keywords: rank aggregation; rank centrality; Markov chain; random walk</p>

<p>Motivated by recent trends in online advertising and advancements made by online publishers, we consider a new form of contract that allows advertisers to specify the number of unique individuals that should see their ad (reach) and the minimum number of times each individual should be exposed (frequency). We develop an optimization framework that aims for minimal under-delivery and proper spread of each campaign over its targeted demographics. As well, we introduce a pattern-based delivery mechanism that allows us to integrate a variety of interesting features into a website’s ad allocation optimization problem that have not been possible before. For example, our approach allows publishers to implement any desired pacing of ads over time at the user level or control the number of competing brands seen by each individual. We develop a two-phase algorithm that employs column generation in a hierarchical scheme with three parallelizable components. Numerical tests with real industry data show that our algorithm produces high-quality solutions and has promising run-time and scalability. Several extensions of the model are presented, e.g., to account for multiple ad positions on the webpage or randomness in the website visitors’ arrival process.<br>An e-companion is available at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2016.1567" target="_blank" rel="external">https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2016.1567</a>.<br>Keywords: online advertising; guaranteed targeted display advertising; reach; frequency; uniform delivery; column generation; cutting stock; quadratic programming</p>

<p>Course Match: A Large-Scale Implementation of Approximate Competitive Equilibrium from Equal Incomes for Combinatorial Allocation<br>Eric Budish<br>University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60637<br>Gérard P.

<p>Combinatorial allocation involves assigning bundles of items to agents when the use of money is not allowed. Course allocation is one common application of combinatorial allocation, in which the bundles are schedules of courses and the assignees are students. Existing mechanisms used in practice have been shown to have serious flaws, which lead to allocations that are inefficient, unfair, or both. A recently developed mechanism is attractive in theory but has several features that limit its feasibility for practice. This paper reports on the design and implementation of a new course allocation mechanism, Course Match, that is suitable in practice. To find allocations, Course Match performs a massive parallel heuristic search that solves billions of mixed-integer programs to output an approximate competitive equilibrium in a fake-money economy for courses. Quantitative summary statistics for two semesters of full-scale use at a large business school (the Wharton School of Business, which has about 1,700 students and up to 350 courses in each semester) demonstrate that Course Match is both fair and efficient, a finding reinforced by student surveys showing large gains in satisfaction and perceived fairness.<br>Keywords: course allocation, mechanism design, parallel search, tabu search, competitive equilibrium</p>

<p>We develop a numerical method for computing all pure strategy subgame-perfect equilibrium values of dynamic strategic games with discrete states and actions. We define a monotone mapping that eliminates dominated strategies, and when applied iteratively, delivers an accurate approximation to the true equilibrium payoffs of the underlying game. Our algorithm has three parts. The first provides an outer approximation to equilibrium values, constructed so that any value outside of this approximation is not an equilibrium value. The second provides an inner approximation; any value contained within this approximation is an equilibrium value. Together, the two approximations deliver a practical check of approximation accuracy. The third part of our algorithm delivers sample equilibrium paths. To illustrate our method, we apply it to a dynamic oligopoly competition with endogenous production capacity.<br>Keywords: dynamic games; multiple equilibria; dynamic oligopoly; computation</p>

<p>The decision to buy an item at a regular price or wait for a possible markdown involves a multidimensional trade-off between the value of the item, the delay in getting it, the likelihood of getting it, and the magnitude of the price discount. Such trade-offs are prone to behavioral anomalies by which human decision makers deviate from the discounted expected utility model. We build an axiomatic preference model that accounts for three well-known anomalies and produces a parsimonious generalization of discounted expected utility. We then plug this behavioral model into a Stackelberg-Nash game between a firm that decides the price discount and a continuum of consumers who decide to wait or buy, anticipating other consumers’ decisions and the resultant likelihood of product availability. We solve the markdown management problem and contrast the results of our model with those under discounted expected utility. We analytically show that accounting for the behavioral anomalies can result in larger markdowns and higher revenue. Finally, we calibrate our model via a laboratory experiment and validate its predictions out-of-sample.<br>Keywords: retail operations; markdown management; probability and time tradeoff; behavioral anomalies; behavioral operations</p>

<p>We consider a single-product, two-source inventory system with Poisson demand and backlogging. Inventory can be replenished through a normal supply source, which consists of a two-stage tandem queue with exponential production time at each stage. We can also place an emergency order by skipping the first stage, for a fee. There is no fixed order cost. There are linear order, holding, and back-order costs. Through a new approach, we obtain optimal ordering policies for the discounted or long-run average cost and also characterize near-optimal heuristic policies. The approach consists of four steps. The first step is to establish an equivalent system, in the sense that it has the same optimal policy as the original system. The second step is to construct a tandem queueing system, where costs are charged in accord with the equivalent system’s cost structure. The third step derives an optimal control of the service rate at each server so as to minimize the tandem queue’s system-wide cost. The fourth and final step is to translate the queue’s optimal policy to an optimal policy for the equivalent system and hence the original system.<br>Keywords: dual-source; stochastic lead time; inventory policy; dynamic programming; tandem queue; optimal control</p>

<p>Technical Note—An Expectation-Maximization Method to Estimate a Rank-Based Choice Model of Demand<br>Garrett van Ryzin<br>Graduate School of Business, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027<br>Gustavo Vulcano<br>Leonard N.

<p>We propose an expectation-maximization (EM) method to estimate customer preferences for a category of products using only sales transaction and product availability data. The demand model combines a general, rank-based discrete choice model of preferences with a Bernoulli process of customer arrivals over time. The discrete choice model is defined by a probability mass function (pmf) on a given set of preference rankings of alternatives, including the no-purchase alternative. Each customer is represented by a preference list, and when faced with a given choice set is assumed to either purchase the available option that ranks highest in her preference list, or not purchase at all if no available product ranks higher than the no-purchase alternative.<br>We apply the EM method to jointly estimate the arrival rate of customers and the pmf of the rank-based choice model, and show that it leads to a remarkably simple and highly efficient estimation procedure. All limit points of the procedure are provably stationary points of the associated incomplete data log-likelihood function, and the output produced are maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs). Our numerical experiments confirm the practical potential of the proposal.<br>The online appendix is available at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2016.1559" target="_blank" rel="external">https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2016.1559</a>.<br>Keywords: demand estimation; demand untruncation; choice behavior; EM method</p>

<p>When a keyword-based search query is received by a search engine, a classified ads website, or an online retailer site, the platform has exponentially many choices in how to sort the search results. Two extreme rules are (a) to use a ranking based on estimated relevance only, which improves customer experience in the long run because of perceived quality and (b) to use a ranking based only on the expected revenue to be generated immediately, which maximizes short-term revenue. Typically, these two objectives and the corresponding rankings differ. A key question then is what middle ground between them should be chosen. We introduce stochastic models that yield elegant solutions for this situation, and we propose effective solution methods to compute a ranking strategy that optimizes long-term revenues. This strategy has a very simple form and is easy to implement if the necessary data is available. It consists of ordering the output items by decreasing order of a score attributed to each, similarly to value models used in practice by e-commerce platforms. This score results from evaluating a simple function of the estimated relevance, the expected revenue of the link, and a real-valued parameter. We find the latter via simulation-based optimization, and its optimal value is related to the endogeneity of user activity in the platform as a function of the relevance offered to them.<br>Keywords: e-commerce; linear ordering; revenue management</p>

<p>The bullwhip effect has been extensively studied primarily based on the analysis of various single-product models with a few exceptions. We extend the single-product analysis to the multiproduct setting of interdependent demand streams with auto-correlation and cross-product correlation, as well as contemporaneous correlation across forecasting errors. We find that interdependency between demand streams plays a critical role in determining the existence and magnitude of the bullwhip effect. Specifically, we consider two operating environments: (a) The firm orders product-specific materials so that the ordering decision is based on the product level; and (b) the firm orders generic materials so that the order decision is based on the category level. We show that, even with demand pooling, a firm operating at the category level can experience a larger bullwhip effect and a larger order variance under certain conditions that depend on the number of products in the category and the demand dependencies.<br>Keywords: bullwhip effect; demand pooling; forecasting</p>

<p>Given a polytope X, a monotone concave univariate function g, and two vectors c and d, we study the discrete optimization problem of finding a vertex of X that maximizes the utility function c’x + g(d’x). This problem has numerous applications in combinatorial optimization with a probabilistic objective, including estimation of project duration with stochastic times, in reliability models, in multinomial logit models and in robust optimization. We show that the problem is 𝒩𝒫-hard for any strictly concave function g even for simple polytopes, such as the uniform matroid, assignment and path polytopes; and propose a 1/2-approximation algorithm for it. We discuss improvements for special cases where g is the square root, log utility, negative exponential utility and multinomial logit probability function. In particular, for the square root function, the approximation ratio is 4/5. We also propose a 1.25-approximation algorithm for a class of minimization problems in which the maximization of the utility function appears as a subproblem. Although the worst-case bounds are tight, computational experiments indicate that the suggested approach finds solutions within 1%–2% optimality gap for most of the instances, and can be considerably faster than the existing alternatives.<br>Keywords: PERT; value-at-risk; multinomial logit; reliability; assortment; submodularity; combinatorial optimization; conic quadratic optimization; robust optimization</p>

<p>Sales promotions are important in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry due to the significant spending on promotions and the fact that a large proportion of FMCG products are sold on promotion. This paper considers the problem of planning sales promotions for an FMCG product in a grocery retail setting. The category manager has to solve the promotion optimization problem (POP) for each product, i.e., how to select a posted price for each period in a finite horizon so as to maximize the retailer’s profit. Through our collaboration with Oracle Retail, we developed an optimization formulation for the POP that can be used by category managers in a grocery environment. Our formulation incorporates business rules that are relevant, in practice. We propose general classes of demand functions (including multiplicative and additive), which incorporate the post-promotion dip effect, and can be estimated from sales data. In general, the POP formulation has a nonlinear objective and is NP-hard. We then propose a linear integer programming (IP) approximation of the POP. We show that the IP has an integral feasible region, and hence can be solved efficiently as a linear program (LP). We develop performance guarantees for the profit of the LP solution relative to the optimal profit. Using sales data from a grocery retailer, we first show that our demand models can be estimated with high accuracy, and then demonstrate that using the LP promotion schedule could potentially increase the profit by 3%, with a potential profit increase of 5% if some business constraints were to be relaxed.<br>The online appendix is available at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2016.1573" target="_blank" rel="external">https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2016.1573</a><br>Keywords: promotion optimization; dynamic pricing; integer programming; retail operations</p>

<p>In order for a patient to be discharged from a hospital unit, a physician must first perform a physical examination and review the pertinent medical information to determine that the patient is stable enough to be transferred to a lower level of care or be discharged home. Requiring an inspection of a patient’s “readiness for discharge” introduces an interesting dynamic where patients may occupy a bed longer than medically necessary. Motivated by this phenomenon, we introduce a queueing system with time-varying arrival rates in which servers who have completed service cannot be released until an inspection occurs. We examine how such a dynamic impacts common system measures such as stability, expected number of customers in the system, probability of waiting, and expected waiting time. Leveraging insights from an infinite-server model, we’re able to optimize the timing of inspections and find via theoretical and numerical analysis that (1) optimizing a single inspection time could lead to significant improvements in system performance when the amplitude of the arrival rate function is large, (2) multiple inspections should be uniformly distributed throughout the day, and (3) the marginal improvements of adding additional inspection times is decreasing.<br>Keywords: queueing; time-varying arrival rates; infinite server queues; healthcare</p>

<p>We consider a family of discrete time multihop switched queueing networks where each packet moves along a fixed route. In this setting, BackPressure is the canonical choice of scheduling policy; this policy has the virtues of possessing a maximal stability region and not requiring explicit knowledge of traffic arrival rates. BackPressure has certain structural weaknesses because implementation requires information about each route, and queueing delays can grow super-linearly with route length. For large networks, where packets over many routes are processed by a queue, or where packets over a route are processed by many queues, these limitations can be prohibitive.<br>In this article, we introduce a scheduling policy for first-in, first-out networks, the ProportionalScheduler, which is based on the proportional fairness criterion. We show that, like BackPressure, the ProportionalScheduler has a maximal stability region and does not require explicit knowledge of traffic arrival rates. The ProportionalScheduler has the advantage that information about the network’s route structure is not required for scheduling, which substantially improves the policy’s performance for large networks. For instance, packets can be routed with only next-hop information and new nodes can be added to the network with only knowledge of the scheduling constraints.<br>Keywords: ProportionalScheduler; BackPressure; Kelly networks; bandwidth sharing networks; Massoulié networks; switch networks; proportional fairness</p>

<p>A Two-Time-Scale Approach to Time-Varying Queues in Hospital Inpatient Flow Management<br>J. G.

<p>We analyze a time-varying Mperi/Geo2timeScale/N queueing system. The arrival process is periodic Poisson. The service time of a customer has components in different time scales: length of stay (LOS) in days and departure time (hdis) in hours. This queueing system has been used to study patient flows from the emergency department (ED) to hospital inpatient wards. In that setting, the LOS of a patient is simply the number of days she spends in a ward, and her departure time hdis is the discharge hour on the day of her discharge.<br>We develop a new analytical framework that can perform exact analysis on this novel queueing system. This framework has two steps: first analyze the midnight customer count process and obtain its stationary distribution, then analyze the time-dependent customer count process to compute various performance measures. We also develop approximation tools that can significantly reduce the computational time. In particular, via Stein’s method, we derive explicit expressions to approximate the stationary distribution of the midnight count. We provide error bounds for these approximations and numerically demonstrate that they are remarkably accurate for systems with various sizes and load conditions. Our theoretical and numerical analysis have produced a number of insights that can be used to improve hospital inpatient flow management. We find that the LOS term affects the overnight wait caused by the mismatch between daily arrivals and discharges, whereas the hdis term affects the intraday wait caused by the nonsynchronization between the arrival and discharge time patterns. Thus, reducing LOS or increasing capacity can impact the daily average performance significantly; shifting the discharge timing to earlier times of a day can alleviate the peak congestion in the morning and mainly affects the time-dependent performance.<br>The e-companion is available at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2016.1566" target="_blank" rel="external">https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2016.1566</a>.<br>Keywords: two-time-scale; time-varying queue; time-dependent performance; approximation; Stein’s method; hospital inpatient operations</p>

<p>Call Center Staffing: Service-Level Constraints and Index Priorities<br>Seung Bum Soh<br>College of Business Administration, Sejong University, Seoul, South Korea<br>Itai Gurvich<br>School of Operations Research and Information Engineering, Cornell Tech, New York, New York 10011<br>Accepted Online: January 24, 2014<br>Received Online: May 6, 2016<br>Published Online: October 28, 2016<br>Operations Research, Volume 65 Issue 2, March-April 2017, pp. 537-555</p>
<p>Call centers attribute different values to different customer segments. These values are reflected in quality-of-service targets. The prevalent target service factor (TSF) formulation requires, for example, that 80% of VIP customers wait less than 20 seconds while setting the target to 30 seconds for non-VIP customers. The call center must determine the staffing level together with a prioritization rule that meets these targets at minimal cost. In practice, because of the underlying complexity of these systems, the prioritization rule is often selected in a heuristic manner rather than being systematically optimized. When considering the universe of prioritization policies, index rules provide a customizable and easy to define heuristic and for this reason are implemented in various call center software packages.<br>We use the TSF formulation as a stepping stone toward a better understanding of index rules. We first construct an asymptotically optimal solution for the TSF problem. The prioritization component of our solution is a tracking policy rather than an index rule. We prove that despite index rules’ significant flexibility, no instance of these prioritization rules is optimal for the TSF problem. The suboptimality of index rules follows from an essential characteristic of these: restricting attention to index rules (as is heuristically done in practice) is asymptotically equivalent to requiring that a VIP customer always waits less than a regular (non-VIP) customer who arrives at the same time. This, in particular, implies that the use of index rules in practice can be rationalized if (and only if) the manager requires such strong differentiation.<br>Keywords: multiclass queues; staffing; priorities; index rules; service-level differentiation</p>

<p>We argue that deterministic market clearing formulations introduce arbitrary distortions between day-ahead and expected real-time prices that bias economic incentives. We extend and analyze a previously proposed stochastic clearing formulation in which the social surplus function induces penalties between day-ahead and real-time quantities. We prove that the formulation yields price bounded price distortions, and we show that adding a similar penalty term to transmission flows and phase angles ensures boundedness throughout the network. We prove that when the price distortions are zero, day-ahead quantities equal a quantile of their real-time counterparts. The undesired effects of price distortions suggest that stochastic settings provide significant benefits over deterministic ones that go beyond social surplus improvements. We propose additional metrics to evaluate these benefits.<br>Keywords: stochastic; electricity; network; market clearing; pricing</p>

<p>Mechanism and Network Design with Private Negative Externalities<br>Alexandre Belloni<br>Fuqua School of Business, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina 27708<br>Changrong Deng<br>Analysis Group, Menlo Park, California 94025<br>Saša Pekeč<br>Fuqua School of Business, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina 27708<br>Accepted Online: July 11, 2014<br>Received Online: October 25, 2016<br>Published Online: April 17, 2017<br>Operations Research, Volume 65 Issue 3, May-June 2017, pp. 577-594</p>
<p>A revenue-maximizing monopolist is selling a single indivisible good to buyers who face a loss if any of its rival buyers obtain it. The rivalry is modeled through a network, an arc between a pair of buyers indicates that a buyer considers another buyer its rival, and the magnitude of the loss is the private information of each buyer. This loss-exposure due to competitive considerations can be viewed as a negative externality. First, using a Myersonian approach we derive the monopolist’s optimal mechanism for any given network. Second, we show that revenues depend on the network structure. Thus, in applications where it is possible, the monopolist might consider designing not only the mechanism but also the network (if not fully, at least partially). Third, we provide and fully describe the solution to the monopolist’s market design problem; that is, the joint network and mechanism design problem. Specifically, despite the nonmonotone impact of additional competition on the monopolist’s revenues, we determine revenue-maximizing rivalry networks (which in turn induce optimal mechanisms) and show that they are independent of distributional assumptions on buyers’ independent private loss values, provided virtual values are bounded from zero. We achieve these results under different restrictions on the network structure and formation. When rivalry is symmetric, matchings are optimal (with at most one path on three vertices). Thus, a market with a fragmented network structure yields higher revenues for the monopolist than a market with a completely connected network structure. However, asymmetric competitive relationships among buyers generate higher revenues than symmetric ones. The optimal asymmetric networks are characterized by (i) every buyer having at least one rival and (ii) the existence of a buyer not considered a rival by anyone.<br>The electronic companion is available at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2016.1585" target="_blank" rel="external">https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2016.1585</a>.<br>Keywords: mechanism design; network design; negative externalities</p>

<p>In this study, we introduce the regenerator location problem in flexible optical networks. With a given traffic demand, the regenerator location problem in flexible optical networks considers the regenerator location, routing, bandwidth allocation, and modulation selection problems jointly to satisfy data transfer demands with the minimum cost regenerator deployment. We propose a novel branch-and-price algorithm for this challenging problem. Using real-world network topologies, we conduct extensive numerical experiments to both test the performance of the proposed solution methodology and evaluate the practical benefits of flexible optical networks. In particular, our results show that, making routing, bandwidth allocation, modulation selection, and regenerator placement decisions in a joint manner, it is possible to obtain drastic capacity enhancements when only a very modest portion of the nodes is endowed with the signal regeneration capability.<br>Keywords: flexible optical networks; regenerator location; relay location; routing; modulation selection; path-segment formulation; branch-and-price</p>

<p>We show that elimination by aspects (EBA) generalizes nested logit and cross-nested logit models. The latter two models are equivalent to a special case of EBA called preference trees. The transformations between preference trees and nested logit models become more complex when the utilities of alternatives are functions of covariates. In this case, a simple model in one domain corresponds to a complex model in the other. An extended EBA model, in which the utilities of alternatives are functions of covariates, represents a two-stage choice process. Alternatives are first screened using a probabilistic lexicographic rule and then compared in terms of their compensatory utilities. We provide a typology of the relations between EBA and other logit models, and we discuss issues concerning estimation, statistical testing, and data collection. We describe an application illustrating (1) the process of constructing a preference tree with covariates and (2) the different implications obtained from a preference tree and a comparable nested logit model.<br>Keywords: elimination by aspects; preference trees; hierarchical elimination model; nested logit model; cross-nested logit model; two-stage choice model; order independence; independence of irrelevant alternatives</p>

<p>We study patient admission policies in a neurology ward where there are multiple types of patients with different medical characteristics. Patients receive specialized care inside the neurology ward and delays in admission to the ward will have negative impact on their health status. The level of this impact varies among patient types and depends on the severity of patients. Patients are also different in terms of arrival rate and length of stay at the ward. The patients normally wait in the emergency department until a ward bed is assigned to them. We formulate this problem as an infinite-horizon average cost dynamic program and propose an efficient approximation scheme to solve large-scale problem instances. The computational results from applying our model to a neurology ward show that dynamic policies generated by our approach can reduce the overall deterioration in patients’ health status compared to several alternative policies.<br>The online appendix is available at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2016.1574" target="_blank" rel="external">https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2016.1574</a>.<br>Keywords: patient admission; neurology ward; approximate dynamic programming</p>

<p>Kernel Smoothing for Nested Estimation with Application to Portfolio Risk Measurement<br>L.

<p>Nested estimation involves estimating an expectation of a function of a conditional expectation via simulation. This problem has of late received increasing attention amongst researchers due to its broad applicability particularly in portfolio risk measurement and in pricing complex derivatives. In this paper, we study a kernel smoothing approach. We analyze its asymptotic properties, and present efficient algorithms for practical implementation. While asymptotic results suggest that the kernel smoothing approach is preferable over nested simulation only for low-dimensional problems, we propose a decomposition technique for portfolio risk measurement, through which a high-dimensional problem may be decomposed into low-dimensional ones that allow an efficient use of the kernel smoothing approach. Numerical studies show that, with the decomposition technique, the kernel smoothing approach works well for a reasonably large portfolio with 200 risk factors. This suggests that the proposed methodology may serve as a viable tool for risk measurement practice.<br>The e-companion is available at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1591" target="_blank" rel="external">https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1591</a>.<br>Keywords: nested estimation; kernel estimation; portfolio risk measurement</p>

<p>Controlling a Fleet of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles to Collect Uncertain Information in a Threat Environment<br>Yan Xia<br>Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, University at Buffalo (SUNY), Buffalo, New York 14260<br>Rajan Batta<br>Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, University at Buffalo (SUNY), Buffalo, New York 14260<br>Rakesh Nagi<br>Department of Industrial and Enterprise Systems Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, Urbana, Illinois 61801<br>Accepted Online: November 2, 2014<br>Received Online: December 15, 2016<br>Published Online: April 11, 2017<br>Operations Research, Volume 65 Issue 3, May-June 2017, pp. 674-692</p>
<p>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been proved to be successful and efficient for information collection in a modern battlefield, especially in areas that are considered to be dangerous for human pilots. Currently, a UAV is remotely controlled by a ground station through frequent data communications, which make the current system vulnerable in a threat environment. We propose a decentralized control strategy while requiring UAVs to maintain radio silence during the entire mission. The strategy is analyzed based on a scenario where a fleet of vehicles is assigned to search and collect uncertain information in a set of regions within a given mission time. We demonstrate that a region-sharing strategy is beneficial even when there is no extra reward gained from additional information collection. Implementing a region-sharing strategy requires solving a decentralized time allocation problem, which is computationally intractable. To overcome this, an approximate formulation is developed under an independence assumption for information collected by different vehicles. This approximate formulation allows us to decompose, by vehicle, the time allocation problem, and obtain an easily implementable policy that takes on a Markovian form. We develop a sufficient condition under which the approximate formulation becomes exact. A numerical study establishes the computational efficiency of the method; only a few CPU seconds are needed for problems with a planning horizon of 300 time units and 40 regions. We further present a case study to illustrate region-sharing behaviors among UAVs while using practical parameter values. Finally, we compare the obtained policy with the optimal policy found using a complete enumeration method for small instances. Under different parameter settings, the average optimality gap ranges from 0.23% to 19.90%.<br>The e-companion is available at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1590" target="_blank" rel="external">https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1590</a>.<br>Keywords: search theory; decentralized control; resource allocation; Markovian policy; multiagent system</p>

<p>In an innovation tournament, an organizer solicits innovative ideas from a number of independent agents. Agents exert effort to develop their solutions, but their outcomes are unknown due to technical uncertainty and/or subjective evaluation criteria. To incentivize agents to make their best effort, the organizer needs to devise a proper award scheme. While extant literature either assumes a winner-take-all scheme a priori or shows its optimality under specific distributions for uncertainty, this paper derives necessary and sufficient conditions under which the winner-take-all scheme is optimal. These conditions are violated when agents perceive it very likely that only few agents receive high evaluation or when a tournament does not require substantial increase in agents’ marginal cost of effort to develop high-quality solutions. Yet, the winner-take-all scheme is optimal in many practical situations, especially when agents have symmetric beliefs about their evaluation. In this case, the organizer should offer a larger winner prize when he is interested in obtaining a higher number of good solutions, but interestingly the organizer need not necessarily raise the winner prize when anticipating more participants to a tournament.<br>The online appendix is available at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2016.1575" target="_blank" rel="external">https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2016.1575</a>.<br>Keywords: games/group decisions; tournament; research and development; innovation</p>

<p>The “integrality” question for dynamic optimization models of inventory control asks if there exists an integral optimal policy, given integral initial inventory levels, capacities, and demand realizations. One practical implication of this question lies in whether or not full-truckload (FTL) shipping is optimal if customer demand is in integral number of truckloads. In this paper, we investigate the integrality question in single-product, multiechelon distribution systems and show that integrality holds under deterministic demand but fails to hold under stochastic demand. In distribution systems with stochastic demand, less-than-truckload (LTL) shipping can be significantly cheaper than the cost of the optimal FTL shipping policy, even in the presence of economies of scale. For instance, this occurs in settings where shipping costs are expected to increase in the future and/or inventories are more expensive to hold upstream than downstream. In such situations, our results highlight the importance of strategically positioning inventory: LTL shipments can offer a more balanced allocation of inventory across the distribution network, leading to benefits that can exceed the savings from FTL shipments due to economies of scale. However, when the cost parameters are fairly constant across time and inventory holding costs are not significantly higher upstream than downstream, then the difference between the costs of optimal FTL and optimal LTL shipping is provably marginal.<br>The online appendix is available at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2016.1586" target="_blank" rel="external">https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2016.1586</a>.<br>Keywords: integrality; inventory models; distribution systems</p>

<p>From forecasting competitions to conditional value-at-risk requirements, the use of multiple quantile assessments is growing in practice. To evaluate them, we use a rule from the general class of proper scoring rules for a forecaster’s multiple quantiles of a single uncertain quantity of interest. The general rule is additive in the component scores. Each component contains a function that measures its quantile’s distance from the realization and weights its contribution to the overall score. To determine this function, we propose that the score of a group’s combined quantile should be better than that of a randomly selected forecaster’s quantile only when the forecasters bracket the realization (i.e., their quantiles do not fall on the same side of the realization). If a score satisfies this property, we say it is sensitive to bracketing. We characterize the class of proper scoring rules that is sensitive to bracketing when the decision maker uses a generalized average to combine forecasters’ quantiles. Finally, we show how weights can be set to match the payoffs in many important business contexts.<br>Keywords: quantile forecasts; forecast evaluation; probability elicitation; proper scoring rules; expert aggregation; expert combination</p>

<p>Optimal Network Design with End-to-End Service Requirements<br>Anantaram Balakrishnan<br>McCombs School of Business, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas 78712<br>Gang Li<br>Management Department, Bentley University, Waltham, Massachusetts 02452<br>Prakash Mirchandani<br>Katz Graduate School of Business, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15260<br>Accepted Online: May 27, 2014<br>Received Online: September 29, 2016<br>Published Online: March 23, 2017<br>Operations Research, Volume 65 Issue 3, May-June 2017, pp. 729-750</p>
<p>Long-term planning for transportation, telecommunications, and other service operations entails designing networks that are both cost effective and responsive. Because infrastructure networks are expensive and the network’s design determines its service capabilities, planners must address complex trade-offs between minimizing the total cost of the network while meeting end-to-end service requirements such as limits on transit time, latency, and transshipments. To address this problem, we study a minimum cost multicommodity network design model to select arcs and route the required flows along these arcs so that each origin-to-destination route satisfies limits on various service metrics. To effectively solve this service network design problem, we focus on a polyhedral approach to strengthen its arc flow formulation. We develop several classes of strong cuts, with appropriate separation procedures, and propose an optimization-based heuristic method. We characterize the dimension of the problem’s feasible region and show that two classes of inequalities are facet-defining under appropriate conditions. Our computational results demonstrate that our Composite method, incorporating the valid inequalities and heuristic algorithm, significantly reduces computational time and generates near-optimal solutions. The model and methods developed in this paper provide a valuable planning tool for service providers in transportation, telecommunication, and other sectors.<br>The online appendix is available at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2016.1579" target="_blank" rel="external">https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2016.1579</a>.<br>Keywords: service networks; polyhedral methods; integer programming</p>

<p>We study joint chance constraints where the distribution of the uncertain parameters is only known to belong to an ambiguity set characterized by the mean and support of the uncertainties and by an upper bound on their dispersion. This setting gives rise to pessimistic (optimistic) ambiguous chance constraints, which require the corresponding classical chance constraints to be satisfied for every (for at least one) distribution in the ambiguity set. We demonstrate that the pessimistic joint chance constraints are conic representable if (i) the constraint coefficients of the decisions are deterministic, (ii) the support set of the uncertain parameters is a cone, and (iii) the dispersion function is of first order, that is, it is positively homogeneous. We also show that pessimistic joint chance constrained programs become intractable as soon as any of the conditions (i), (ii) or (iii) is relaxed in the mildest possible way. We further prove that the optimistic joint chance constraints are conic representable if (i) holds, and that they become intractable if (i) is violated. We show in numerical experiments that our results allow us to solve large-scale project management and image reconstruction models to global optimality.<br>The online appendix is available at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2016.1583" target="_blank" rel="external">https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2016.1583</a>.<br>Keywords: robust optimization; distributionally robust optimization; joint chance constraints</p>

<p>We examine bilevel mixed-integer programs whose constraints and objective functions depend on both upper- and lower-level variables. The class of problems we consider allows for nonlinear terms to appear in both the constraints and the objective functions, requires all upper-level variables to be integer, and allows a subset of the lower-level variables to be integer. This class of bilevel problems is difficult to solve because the upper-level feasible region is defined in part by optimality conditions governing the lower-level variables, which are difficult to characterize because of the nonconvexity of the follower problem. We propose an exact finite algorithm for these problems based on an optimal-value-function reformulation. We demonstrate how this algorithm can be tailored to accommodate either optimistic or pessimistic assumptions on the follower behavior. Computational experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms a state-of-the-art algorithm for solving bilevel mixed-integer linear programs.<br>Keywords: bilevel optimization; integer programming; nonlinear programming; scheduling</p>

<p>A New Budget Allocation Framework for the Expected Opportunity Cost<br>Siyang Gao<br>Department of Systems Engineering and Engineering Management, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong<br>Weiwei Chen<br>Department of Supply Chain Management, Rutgers University, Newark, New Jersey 07102<br>Leyuan Shi<br>Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, University of Wisconsin–Madison, Madison, Wisconsin 53706; and Department of Industrial Engineering and Management, Peking University, Beijing 100087, China<br>Accepted Online: December 17, 2014<br>Received Online: October 25, 2016<br>Published Online: March 20, 2017<br>Operations Research, Volume 65 Issue 3, May-June 2017, pp. 787-803</p>
<p>In this paper, we present a new budget allocation framework for the problem of selecting the best simulated design from a finite set of alternatives. The new framework is developed on the basis of general underlying distributions and a finite simulation budget. It adopts the expected opportunity cost (EOC) quality measure, which, compared to the traditional probability of correct selection (PCS) measure, penalizes a particularly bad choice more than a slightly incorrect selection, and is thus preferred by risk-neutral practitioners and decision makers. To this end, we establish a closed-form approximation of EOC to formulate the budget allocation problem and derive the corresponding optimality conditions. A sequential budget allocation algorithm is then developed for implementation. The efficiency of the proposed method is illustrated via numerical experiments. We also link the EOC and PCS-based budget allocation problems by showing that the two are asymptotically equivalent. This result explains, to some extent, the similarity in performance between the EOC and PCS allocation procedures observed in the literature.<br>The online appendix is available at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2016.1581" target="_blank" rel="external">https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2016.1581</a>.<br>Keywords: simulation optimization; simulation budget allocation; expected opportunity cost; sequential procedure</p>

<p>Classical models of customer decision making in unobservable queues assume acquiring queue length information is too costly. However, due to recent advancements in communication technology, various services now make this kind of information accessible to customers at a reasonable cost. In our model, which reflects this new opportunity, customers choose among three options: join the queue, balk, or inspect the queue length before deciding whether to join. Inspection is associated with a cost. We compute the equilibrium in this model and prove its existence and uniqueness. Based on two normalized parameters—congestion and service valuation—we map all possible input parameter sets into three scenarios. Each scenario is characterized by a different impact of inspection cost on equilibrium and revenue-maximization queue disclosure policy: fully observable (when inspection cost is very low), fully unobservable (when inspection cost is too high), or observable by demand (when inspection cost is at an intermediate level). We show that when maximizing social welfare, the optimal disclosure policy is zero inspection cost. We show the structure remains the same when a fraction of the customers are considered urgent, that is, they always join, whereas the others are nonurgent and therefore join according to their equilibrium strategy.<br>Keywords: queueing theory; game theory; M/M/1 Markovian queue; strategic customers</p>

<p>The goal of ranking and selection (R&amp;S) procedures is to identify the best stochastic system from among a finite set of competing alternatives. Such procedures require constructing estimates of each system’s performance, which can be obtained simultaneously by running multiple independent replications on a parallel computing platform. Nontrivial statistical and implementation issues arise when designing R&amp;S procedures for a parallel computing environment. We propose several design principles for parallel R&amp;S procedures that preserve statistical validity and maximize core utilization, especially when large numbers of alternatives or cores are involved. These principles are followed closely by our parallel Good Selection Procedure (GSP), which, under the assumption of normally distributed output, (i) guarantees to select a system in the indifference zone with high probability, (ii) in tests on up to 1,024 parallel cores runs efficiently, and (iii) in an example uses smaller sample sizes compared to existing parallel procedures, particularly for large problems (over 106 alternatives). In our computational study we discuss three methods for implementing GSP on parallel computers, namely the Message-Passing Interface (MPI), Hadoop MapReduce, and Spark, and show that Spark provides a good compromise between the efficiency of MPI and robustness to core failures.<br>The e-companion is available at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2016.1577" target="_blank" rel="external">https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2016.1577</a>.<br>Keywords: ranking and selection; parallel computing</p>

<p>We propose an inverse optimization-based methodology to determine market structure from commodity and transportation prices. The methods are appropriate for locational marginal price-based electricity markets where prices are shadow prices in the centralized optimization used to clear the market. We apply the inverse optimization methodology to outcome data from the Midcontinent ISO electricity market (MISO) and, under noise-free assumptions, recover parameters of transmission and related constraints that are not revealed to market participants but explain the price variation. We demonstrate and evaluate analytical uses of the recovered structure including reconstruction of the pricing mechanism and investigations of locational market power through the transmission constrained residual demand derivative. Prices generated from the reconstructed mechanism are highly correlated to actual MISO prices under a wide variety of market conditions. In a case study, the residual demand derivative is shown to be correlated with coefficients of certain transmission constraints.<br>The online appendix is available at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1606" target="_blank" rel="external">https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1606</a>.<br>Keywords: inverse optimization; electricity markets; locational pricing; residual demand derivative</p>

<p>Modeling Gas Markets with Endogenous Long-Term Contracts<br>Ibrahim Abada<br>ENGIE, 92930 Paris la Defense, France<br>Andreas Ehrenmann<br>ENGIE, 92930 Paris la Defense, France<br>Yves Smeers<br>Center for Operations Research and Econometrics, B-1348 Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium<br>Accepted Online: June 16, 2014<br>Received Online: December 15, 2016<br>Published Online: June 02, 2017<br>Operations Research, Volume 65 Issue 4, July-August 2017, pp. 856-877</p>
<p>Since its initial development, long-term contracts have been associated with the gas industry in all regions of the world. This was also the case in Europe where natural gas trade was, for a long time, dominated by bilateral long-term agreements between producers and midstreamers. These contracts fixed a minimum volume to be exchanged (take or pay) and indexed the gas price using a price formula that usually referred to oil product prices. These arrangements allowed market risk sharing between the producer (who takes the price risk) and the midstreamer (who takes the volume risk). They also offered risk hedging since oil is considered as a trusted commodity by investors. The fall of the European natural gas demand, combined with the increase of the oil price, favored the emergence of a gas volume bubble that caused significant losses for most of the European midstreamers bound by long-term agreements. As a result, the downstream part of the industry brought forward the idea of indexing contracts on gas spot prices. In this paper, we present an equilibrium model that endogenously captures the contracting behavior of both producer and midstreamer, who strive to hedge their profit-related risk. Players can choose between gas forward and oil-indexed contracts. Using the model, we show that (i) contracting can reduce the trade risk for both producer and midstreamer; (ii) oil-indexed contracts should be signed only when oil and gas spot prices are well correlated, otherwise, these contracts hold less interest for risk mitigation; (iii) contracts are best suited when the upstream cost structure is mainly driven by capital costs; and (iv) a high level of risk aversion from the midstreamer might deprive upstream investments and downstream consumer surplus.<br>The online appendix is available at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1599" target="_blank" rel="external">https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1599</a>.<br>Keywords: energy; risk analysis; stochastic complementarity modeling</p>

<p>Optimal Contracts for Intermediaries in Online Advertising<br>Santiago R.

<p>In online advertising, the prevalent method advertisers employ to acquire impressions is to contract with an intermediary. These contracts involve upfront payments made by the advertisers to the intermediary, in exchange for running campaigns on their behalf. This paper studies the optimal contract offered by the intermediary in a setting where advertisers’ budgets and targeting criteria are private. This problem can naturally be formulated as a multidimensional mechanism design problem, which in general is hard to solve. We tackle this problem by combining a performance space characterization technique, which relies on delineating the expected cost and value achievable by any feasible (dynamic) bidding policy, and a duality-based approach, which reduces the optimal contract design problem to a tractable convex optimization problem. This approach yields a crisp characterization of the intermediary’s optimal bidding policy: the policy is stationary and bids a weighted average of the values associated with different types (to guarantee that the advertiser reports her type truthfully) that is appropriately shaded (to account for budget constraints). Additionally, when advertisers have identical value distributions, our formulation yields a closed-form characterization of the optimal contract. Our results indicate that an intermediary can profitably provide bidding service to a budget-constrained advertiser and at the same time increase the overall market efficiency.<br>The online appendix is available at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1618" target="_blank" rel="external">https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1618</a>.<br>Keywords: intermediary problems; mechanism design; Internet advertising; repeated auctions; budget constraints</p>

<p>Optimal Dynamic Auctions for Display Advertising<br>Ying-Ju Chen<br>School of Business and Management and School of Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong<br>Accepted Online: March 9, 2010<br>Received Online: December 17, 2016<br>Published Online: April 28, 2017<br>Operations Research, Volume 65 Issue 4, July-August 2017, pp. 897-913</p>
<p>In this paper, we investigate the optimal dynamic auction design for the display advertising industry. Currently, display advertising is sold through two markets side by side. In the traditional guaranteed market, the publisher commits to deliver a prespecified number of impressions within a fixed time frame through a guaranteed contract. In the spot market, the publisher runs an auction to allocate the impressions every period, and the supply of heterogeneous impressions is highly uncertain and nonstorable. Thus, the publisher must solve a dynamic capacity allocation problem of heterogeneous impressions across different contracts and markets, taking into account the uncertainties from both the demand and supply sides.<br>We characterize the precise trade-offs between extracting the revenue from the spot markets, materializing the instantaneous benefit shared with the guaranteed advertisers, and releasing the pressure of paying the penalty related to guaranteed contracts. Furthermore, we identify the dual role of the publisher as a system designer and as a bidder on behalf of the guaranteed advertisers. With heterogeneous due dates of guaranteed contracts, we demonstrate the inherent scheduling issue embedded in this dynamic revenue management problem, and completely solve the joint scheduling and capacity allocation problem for some special cases.<br>The online appendix is available at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1592" target="_blank" rel="external">https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1592</a>.<br>Keywords: display advertising; dynamic auctions; uncertain supply; mechanism design</p>

<p>The acquisition of production flexibility is a well-documented strategy pursued by many firms to counteract certain operational constraints. However, these flexibilities can increase the complexity of a production system and the difficulties in managing increased complexity may hinder exploiting the full benefit of flexibility. In this paper, we consider one such flexibility paradox at an agribusiness firm for an annual $800 million production decision: The firm produces a number of products (hybrid seeds) using limited inventories of several raw materials (parent seeds) and a production process that is subject to random variations. To handle the raw material availability constraint and to partially mitigate the supply risk, the firm invests in a costly second production in South America that can be used if the yield in the first production in North America is low. We solve this joint problem of raw material allocation and sequential production by reformulating it as a tractable simultaneous optimization problem. This tractable reformulation provides an exact solution in practical time durations for large assortments of products. We also establish that when profit margins are sufficiently high, sequential production has less cost, on average, than single production. The solution developed is in use at the firm and has led to an estimated increase in profit by 2%–3% annually.<br>Keywords: flexibility paradox; sequential production; benefits of flexibility</p>

<p>Exact Simulation of the SABR Model<br>Ning Cai<br>Department of Industrial Engineering and Logistics Management, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, Hong Kong<br>Yingda Song<br>Antai College of Economics and Management, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China 200030<br>Nan Chen<br>Department of Systems Engineering and Engineering Management, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong<br>Accepted Online: July 16, 2011<br>Received Online: January 25, 2017<br>Published Online: June 30, 2017<br>Operations Research, Volume 65 Issue 4, July-August 2017, pp. 931-951</p>
<p>The stochastic alpha-beta-rho (SABR) model becomes popular in the financial industry because it is capable of providing good fits to various types of implied volatility curves observed in the marketplace. However, no analytical solution to the SABR model exists that can be simulated directly. This paper explores the possibility of exact simulation for the SABR model. Our contribution is threefold. (i) We propose an exact simulation method for the forward price and its volatility in two special but practically interesting cases, i.e., when the elasticity β = 1, or when β &lt; 1 and the price and volatility processes are instantaneously uncorrelated. Primary difficulties involved are how to simulate two random variables whose distributions can be expressed in terms of the Hartman-Watson and the noncentral chi-squared distribution functions, respectively. Two novel simulation schemes are proposed to achieve numerical accuracy, efficiency, and stability. One stems from numerical Laplace inversion and Asian option literature, and the other is based on recent developments in evaluating the noncentral chi-squared distribution functions in a robust way. Numerical examples demonstrate that our method is fast and accurate under various market environments. (ii) When β &lt; 1 but the price and volatility processes are correlated, our simulation method becomes a semi-exact one. Numerical results suggest that it is still quite accurate when the time horizon is not long, e.g., no greater than one year. For long time horizons, a piecewise semi-exactsimulation scheme is developed that reduces the biases substantially. (iii) For European option pricing under the SABR model, we propose a conditional simulation method, which reduces the variance of the plain simulation significantly, e.g., by more than 99%.<br>The e-companion is available at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1617" target="_blank" rel="external">https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1617</a>.<br>Keywords: exact simulation; SABR model; semi-exact simulation; piecewise semi-exact simulation; time change; Asian options; noncentral chi-squared distributions; Hartman-Watson distributions</p>

<p>When a firm faces an uncertain demand, it is common to procure supply using some type of option in addition to spot purchases. A typical version of this problem involves capacity being purchased in advance, with a separate payment made that applies only to the part of the capacity that is needed. We consider a discrete version of this problem in which competing suppliers choose a reservation price and an execution price for blocks of capacity, and the buyer, facing known distributions of demand and spot price, needs to decide which blocks to reserve. We show how to solve the buyer’s (combinatorial) problem efficiently and also show that suppliers can do no better than offer blocks at execution prices that match their costs, making profits only from the reservation part of their bids. Finally we show that in an equilibrium the buyer selects the welfare maximizing set of blocks.<br>The online appendix is available at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1593" target="_blank" rel="external">https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1593</a>.<br>Keywords: supply option; competitive bidding; discrete blocks; submodularity; Nash equilibrium</p>

<p>We consider the allocation of inventory to stores in a “merchandise test,” whereby a fashion retailer deploys a new product to stores in limited quantities in order to learn about demand prior to the main selling season. Our problem formulation includes practical considerations like fixed costs and multiperiod inventory considerations but is challenging to analyze directly. Instead, we take a bounding approach that isolates the novel aspect of our problem: the impact of test inventory allocation on demand learning. We specifically examine a trade-off between the quantity of stores tested and the quality of observations, which can be impacted by demand censoring due to inventory stockouts. We find that the visibility into the timing of each sales transaction has a pivotal impact on the allocation decisions that optimize learning. When such timing information is unobservable, the retailer may need to consolidate inventory in few stores to increase service levels during the test and thereby to minimize the negative impacts of demand censoring. When sales timing information is observable, the retailer optimizes learning by maximizing the number of sales during the test period without regard to stockouts in individual stores. In a numerical study, we show that heuristics motivated by our analyses are near optimal and that inefficient allocations can considerably reduce the learning value of the merchandise test. We also examine the interplay between the retailer’s learning incentive and the natural incentives brought by fixed costs and profits earned during the test itself. We find that it is sufficient for the retailer to consider only the learning incentive when the main selling period is relatively long compared with the testing period.<br>The online appendix is available at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1596" target="_blank" rel="external">https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1596</a>.<br>Keywords: merchandise testing; retailing; Bayesian inventory management; demand censoring</p>

<p>Node, Edge, Arc Routing and Turn Penalties: Multiple Problems—One Neighborhood Extension<br>Thibaut Vidal<br>Departamento de Informática, Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro 22451-900, Brazil<br>Accepted Online: April 6, 2015<br>Received Online: December 15, 2016<br>Published Online: May 16, 2017<br>Operations Research, Volume 65 Issue 4, July-August 2017, pp. 992-1010</p>
<p>This article explores a structural neighborhood decomposition for arc routing problems, in which the decisions about traversal orientations during services are made optimally as part of neighbor evaluation procedures. Using memory structures, bidirectional dynamic programming, and lower bounds, we show that a large neighborhood involving classical moves on the sequences of services along with optimal orientation decisions can be searched in amortized O(1) time per move evaluation instead of O(n) as in previous works. Because of its generality and now-reduced complexity, this approach can be efficiently applied to several variants of arc routing problems, extended into large neighborhoods such as ejection chains, and integrated into two classical metaheuristics. Our computational experiments lead to solutions of high quality on the main benchmark sets for the capacitated arc routing problem (CARP), the mixed capacitated general routing problem (MCGRP), the periodic CARP, the multidepot CARP, and the min-max k-vehicles windy rural postman problem, with a total of 1,528 instances. We also report sensitivity analyses for new MCGRP instances with turn penalties, which are uncommonly challenging yet critical for many practical applications.<br>The e-companion is available at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1595" target="_blank" rel="external">https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1595</a><br>Keywords: arc routing; general routing; turn penalties; service clusters; heuristics; structural problem decomposition; local search; large neighborhoods</p>

<p>Risk Aversion, Information Acquisition, and Technology Adoption<br>James E.

<p>We use a dynamic programming model to study the impacts of risk aversion on information acquisition in technology adoption decisions. In this model, the benefit of the technology is uncertain and, in each period, the decision maker (DM) may adopt the technology, reject the technology, or pay to acquire a signal about the benefit of the technology. The dynamic programming state variables are the DM’s wealth and a probability distribution that describes the DM’s beliefs about the benefit of the technology; these distributions are updated over time using Bayes’ rule. If the signal-generating process satisfies the monotone-likelihood ratio property and the DM is risk neutral, the value functions and policies satisfy natural monotonicity properties: a likelihood-ratio improvement in the distribution on benefits leads to an increase in the value function and moves the DM away from rejection and toward adoption. With risk aversion, the value functions (now representing expected utilities) will be monotonic, but the policies need not be monotonic, even with reasonable utility functions. However, if we assume the DM exhibits decreasing absolute risk aversion and is not “too risk averse,” the policies can be shown to be monotonic. Establishing these structural properties requires the use of some novel proof techniques that may prove useful in other contexts. We also study the impact of changing risk attitudes on the optimal policy.<br>The online appendix is available at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1601" target="_blank" rel="external">https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1601</a>.<br>Keywords: dynamic programming; Bayesian decision analysis; sequential</p>

<p>We consider discounted Markov decision processes (MDPs) with countably-infinite state spaces, finite action spaces, and unbounded rewards. Typical examples of such MDPs are inventory management and queueing control problems in which there is no specific limit on the size of inventory or queue. Existing solution methods obtain a sequence of policies that converges to optimality in value but may not improve monotonically, ie., a policy in the sequence may be worse than preceding policies. Our proposed approach considers countably-infinite linear programming (CILP) formulations of the MDPs (a CILP is defined as a linear program (LP) with countably-infinite numbers of variables and constraints). Under standard assumptions for analyzing MDPs with countably-infinite state spaces and unbounded rewards, we extend the major theoretical extreme point and duality results to the resulting CILPs. Under additional mild assumptions, which are satisfied by several applications of interest, we present a simplex-type algorithm that is implementable in the sense that each of its iterations requires only a finite amount of data and computation. We show that the algorithm finds a sequence of policies that improves monotonically and converges to optimality in value. Unlike existing simplex-type algorithms for CILPs, our proposed algorithm solves a class of CILPs in which each constraint may contain an infinite number of variables and each variable may appear in an infinite number of constraints. A numerical illustration for inventory management problems is also presented.<br>The online appendix is available at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1598" target="_blank" rel="external">https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1598</a>.<br>Keywords: simplex algorithm; infinite linear programs; dynamic programming</p>

<p>We present a randomized O(log n/log log n)-approximation algorithm for the asymmetric traveling salesman problem (ATSP). This provides the first asymptotic improvement over the long-standing Θ(log n)-approximation bound stemming from the work of Frieze et al. (1982) [Frieze AM, Galbiati G, Maffioki F (1982) On the worst-case performance of some algorithms for the asymmetric traveling salesman problem. Networks 12(1):23–39].<br>The key ingredient of our approach is a new connection between the approximability of the ATSP and the notion of so-called thin trees. To exploit this connection, we employ maximum entropy rounding—a novel method of randomized rounding of LP relaxations of optimization problems. We believe that this method might be of independent interest.<br>Keywords: traveling salesman problem; linear programming; maximum entropy; thin tree; Held-Karp relaxation; randomized rounding</p>

<p>Approximating the function that maps the input parameters of the simulation model to the expectation of the simulation output is an important and challenging problem in stochastic simulation metamodeling. Because an expectation is an integral, this function approximation problem can be seen as parametric integration—approximating the function that maps a parameter vector to the integral of an integrand that depends on the parameter vector. S. Heinrich and coauthors have proved that the multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) method improves the computational complexity of parametric integration, under some conditions. We prove similar results under different conditions that are more applicable to stochastic simulation metamodeling problems in operations research. We also propose a practical MLMC procedure for stochastic simulation metamodeling with user-driven error tolerance. In our simulation experiments, this procedure was up to tens of thousands of times faster than standard Monte Carlo.<br>The electronic companion is available at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1607" target="_blank" rel="external">https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1607</a>.<br>Keywords: design of experiments; efficiency</p>

<p>Redundancy is an important strategy for reducing response time in multi-server distributed queueing systems. This strategy has been used in a variety of settings, but only recently have researchers begun analytical studies. The idea behind redundancy is that customers can greatly reduce response time by waiting in multiple queues at the same time, thereby experiencing the minimum time across queues. Redundancy has been shown to produce significant response time improvements in applications ranging from organ transplant waitlists to Google’s BigTable service. However, despite the growing body of theoretical and empirical work on the benefits of redundancy, there is little work addressing the questions of how many copies one needs to make to achieve a response time benefit, and the magnitude of the potential gains.<br>In this paper we propose a theoretical model and dispatching policy to evaluate these questions. Our system consists of k servers, each with its own queue. We introduce the Redundancy-d policy, under which each incoming job makes copies at a constant number of servers, d, chosen at random. Under the assumption that a job’s service times are exponential and independent across servers, we derive the first exact expressions for mean response time in Redundancy-d systems with any finite number of servers, as well as expressions for the distribution of response time which are exact as the number of servers approaches infinity. Using our analysis, we show that mean response time decreases as d increases, and that the biggest marginal response time improvement comes from having each job wait in only d = 2 queues.<br>The e-companion is available at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2016.1582" target="_blank" rel="external">https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2016.1582</a>.<br>Keywords: redundancy; replication; task assignment; dispatching</p>

<p>Production with Risk Hedging—Optimal Policy and Efficient Frontier<br>Liao Wang<br>Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027<br>David D.

<p>Demand for many products may depend on the price of a tradable asset or on the economy in general. For example, demand for equipment that plants or harvests corn correlates with the corn price on the commodity market, and discount stores experienced increased sales revenue during the last recession. Thus, we model demand as a stochastic process with two components: in addition to the usual Gaussian component reflecting demand volatility, there is a drift component taking the form of a function of a tradable asset price. (In the case of dependence on the general economy, the asset price can be a broad market index, such as the S&amp;P 500 Index.) With this demand model, we study the one-time production quantity decision along with a real-time risk-hedging strategy over a given planning horizon (the production cycle). Pursuing a mean-variance formulation, we derive the optimal solution to both production and hedging decisions. We give a complete characterization of the efficient frontier and quantify the improvement in risk-return trade-off achieved by the hedging strategy. Furthermore, we show that the hedging strategy is self-financing in the sense that the expected total wealth from both production and hedging stays nonnegative at all times.<br>The online appendix is available at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1597" target="_blank" rel="external">https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1597</a><br>Keywords: operational risk management; quadratic hedging; mean-variance efficient frontier</p>
<p>Volume 65 Issue 5<br>Using Experts’ Noisy Quantile Judgments to Quantify Risks: Theory and Application to Agribusiness<br>Saurabh Bansal<br>The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802<br>Genaro J.

<p>Motivated by a unique agribusiness setting, this paper develops an optimization-based approach to estimate the mean and standard deviation of probability distributions from noisy quantile judgments provided by experts. The approach estimates the mean and standard deviations as weighted linear combinations of quantile judgments, where the weights are explicit functions of the expert’s judgmental errors. The approach is analytically tractable, and provides flexibility to elicit any set of quantiles from an expert. The approach also establishes that using an expert’s quantile judgments to deduce the distribution parameters is equivalent to collecting data with a specific sample size and enables combining the expert’s judgments with those of other experts. It also shows analytically that the weights for the mean add up to one and the weights for the standard deviation add up to zero—these properties have been observed numerically in the literature in the last 30 years, but without a systematic explanation. The theory has been in use at Dow AgroSciences for two years for making an annual decision worth $800 million. The use of the approach has resulted in the following monetary benefits: (i) firm’s annual production investment has reduced by 6%–7% and (ii) profit has increased by 2%–3%. We discuss the implementation at the firm, and provide practical guidelines for using expert judgment for operational uncertainties in industrial settings.<br>The online appendix is available at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1627" target="_blank" rel="external">https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1627</a>.<br>Keywords: expert judgments; quantile judgments; estimating distributions; bootstrap; yield uncertainty</p>

<p>Transplant centers screen patients on the kidney transplant waiting list to identify patients with severe conditions such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), which makes them ineligible for a transplant. We propose a model for finding screening strategies, with the objective of minimizing the sum of the expected screening cost and the expected penalty cost associated with transplanting an organ to an ineligible patient. Our results suggest that current screening guidelines, which are based only on patients’ risk for developing CVD, are significantly dominated by policies that also consider factors related to patients’ waiting time. In particular, our numerical experiments based on waiting list data in British Columbia show that compared with the current screening policy, our model-based policy results in a 35.6% reduction in the total annual cost by reducing the percentage of kidneys offered to patients with undetected CVD by 57.4% while using only 5% more screenings per year.<br>The online appendix is available at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1632" target="_blank" rel="external">https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1632</a>.<br>Keywords: stochastic optimization; reliability; screening policy; kidney transplant waiting list; cardiovascular disease</p>

<p>Single and Multisettlement Approaches to Market Clearing Under Demand Uncertainty<br>Javad Khazaei<br>Department of Operations Research and Financial Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey 08544<br>Golbon Zakeri<br>Department of Engineering Science, University of Auckland, Auckland 1010, New Zealand<br>Shmuel S.

<p>Participants in electricity markets face a substantial amount of uncertainty, and with increased penetration of volatile renewable generation this uncertainty has further increased. Conventionally designed electricity markets cope with uncertainty by running two markets: a market that is cleared ahead of time, followed by a real-time balancing market to reconcile actual realizations of demand and available generation. In such mechanisms, the initial clearing process does not take into account the distribution of outcomes in the balancing market. Recently, an alternative so-called stochastic settlement market has been proposed (see, e.g., Pritchard et al. 2010 [Pritchard G, Zakeri G, Philpott A (2010) A single-settlement, energy-only electric power market for unpredictable and intermittent participants. Oper. Res. 58(4):1210–1219.] and Bouffard et al. 2005 [Bouffard F, Galiana FD, Conejo AJ (2005) Market-clearing with stochastic security—Part I: Formulation. IEEE Trans. Power Systems 20(4):1818–1826.]) where the ISO clears both stages in one single settlement market.<br>While the effectiveness of the stochastic market clearing mechanism is clear when the market is competitive, this is open to question for imperfectly competitive markets. In this paper we consider simplified models for two types of market clearing mechanisms. First, a market clearing mechanism utilized in New Zealand, whereby firms offer in advance and are notified of a clearing quantity and price guide based on an estimate of demand, followed by real-time dispatch. We refer to this as NZTS. Secondly we consider a simplified stochastic programming market clearing mechanism. We compute Nash equilibria of games resulting from each of the market clearing mechanisms. We prove that under the assumption of symmetry, our simplified stochastic programming market clearing is equivalent to a two-period single settlement system that takes account of deviation penalties in the second stage. These, however, differ from NZTS. We show that when we assume symmetry, this stochastic settlement model results in better social welfare than does NZTS. We also investigate a number of asymmetric examples numerically.<br>The e-companion is available at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1610" target="_blank" rel="external">https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1610</a>.<br>Keywords: uncertainty; stochastic programming; electricity markets; equilibrium; market clearing</p>

<p>In many competitive situations (including nearly all sports) a player’s aim is not simply to maximise his score but to maximise its rank among all scores. Examples include sales contests (where the salesman with the highest monthly sales gets a bonus) and patent races (where lowest time is best). We assume the score Xi of player i is obtained costlessly, so that his utility is the probability of having the best score. This gives a constant-sum game. All that matters for player i is the distribution of his score, so we assume he chooses from a given convex set of distributions ℱi. We call such games distribution ranking games, and characterise their solution for various classes of the distribution sets ℱi, such as distributions with given mean or moment, where we extend a result of Bell and Cover.<br>Keywords: game theory; gambling; contests; league tables; sport; fund management</p>

<p>Optimal Three-Part Tariff Plans<br>Gadi Fibich<br>School of Mathematical Sciences, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv 69978, Israel<br>Roy Klein<br>School of Mathematical Sciences, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv 69978, Israel<br>Oded Koenigsberg<br>London Business School, London NW1 4SA, United Kingdom<br>Eitan Muller<br>Interdisciplinary Center (IDC), Herzelia 4610101, Israel; and New York University, New York, New York 10012<br>Accepted Online: April 6, 2015<br>Received Online: December 15, 2016<br>Published Online: June 14, 2017<br>Operations Research, Volume 65 Issue 5, September-October 2017, pp. 1177-1189</p>
<p>Service providers, such as cell phone carriers, often offer three-part tariff plans that consist of three levers: A fixed fee, an allowance of free units, and a price per unit above the allowance. In previous studies the optimal three-part tariff contract was characterized using the standard first-order conditions approach. Because this optimization problem is nonsmooth, however, it could only be solved in a few simple cases. In this study we employ a different methodology that is based on obtaining a global bound for the firm profit, and then showing that this bound is attained by the optimal plan. This approach allows us to explicitly calculate the optimal three-part tariff plan under quite general conditions, where consumers are rational, they have a general utility function, they experience psychological costs when they exceed the number of free units, they have deterministic or stochastic consumption rates, they are homogeneous or heterogeneous, and the firm costs are fixed or depend on the usage level.<br>The online appendix is available at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1609" target="_blank" rel="external">https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1609</a>.<br>Keywords: nonlinear pricing; three-part tariff; nonsmooth optimization</p>

<p>In this article, we propose an exact simulation method of the Wishart multidimensional stochastic volatility (WMSV) model—a single asset model with a multidimensional Wishart variance process. Our method is based on analysis of the conditional characteristic function of the log-price given a terminal volatility level. In particular, we found an explicit expression for the conditional characteristic function for the Heston model. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our new method is much faster and reliable than the Euler discretization method.<br>Keywords: Wishart processes; stochastic volatility; Monte-Carlo method; exact simulation</p>

<p>Hide-and-Seek Games on a Network, Using Combinatorial Search Paths<br>Steve Alpern<br>ORMS Group, Warwick Business School, University of Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, United Kingdom<br>Accepted Online: March 13, 2016<br>Received Online: December 15, 2016<br>Published Online: April 28, 2017<br>Operations Research, Volume 65 Issue 5, September-October 2017, pp. 1207-1214</p>
<p>This paper introduces a new search paradigm to hide-and-seek games on networks. The Hider locates at any point on any arc. The Searcher adopts a “combinatorial” path when searching the network: a sequence of arcs, each adjacent to the last, and traced out at unit speed. In previous literature the Searcher was allowed “simple motion,” any unit speed path, including ones that turn around inside an arc. The new approach more closely models real problems such as search for improvised explosive devices using vehicles that can only turn around at particular locations on a road. The search game is zero sum, with the time taken to find the Hider as the payoff.<br>Using a lemma giving an upper bound for the expected search time on a semi Eulerian network, we solve the search game on a network Q3 consisting of two nodes connected by three arcs of arbitrary lengths. When two Q3 networks with unit length arcs are linked by two small central arcs incident at the start node, one of these arcs must be traversed at least three times in an optimal search. This property holds for both combinatorial paths and simple motion paths, and the latter makes it a counterexample to a conjecture of Gal, which said that two traversals were always sufficient.<br>Keywords: search game; network; hide-seek; zero sum game</p>

<p>Optimal Pricing of Correlated Product Options Under the Paired Combinatorial Logit Model<br>Hongmin Li<br>W. P.

<p>In this paper, we study price optimization with price-demand relationships captured by the paired combinatorial logit (PCL) model, which overcomes restrictions of the well-studied multinomial logit (MNL) and nested logit (NL) models. The PCL model allows for choice-correlation and, like the NL model, includes the MNL model as a special case. Compared to the NL models, the PCL model does not restrict the sequence of the choice structure and allows for different covariances among all pairs of choices. This additional flexibility in structure enables a more accurate representation of some choice settings and broadens its empirical applications. Hence, it is of both theoretical and practical interests to extend the normative studies on the MNL and NL models to the PCL model and examine the pricing problem under this model. Due to cross-nesting of choice alternatives, the pricing problem under the PCL model poses a greater challenge than the MNL and NL models. However, using the concept of P-matrix, we are able to identify conditions for a unique optimal price solution and develop an efficient and theoretically sound approach for finding the optimal prices. We show that the analysis and solution approach are generalizable to other GEV family models with cross-nested alternatives.<br>The online appendix is available at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1614" target="_blank" rel="external">https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1614</a>.<br>Keywords: pricing; revenue management; paired combinatorial logit; cross-nested logit</p>

<p>Serial Inventory Systems with Markov-Modulated Demand: Derivative Bounds, Asymptotic Analysis, and Insights<br>Li Chen<br>Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853<br>Jing-Sheng Song<br>Fuqua School of Business, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina 27708<br>Yue Zhang<br>Smeal College of Business, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802<br>Accepted Online: October 18, 2014<br>Received Online: January 25, 2017<br>Published Online: June 27, 2017<br>Operations Research, Volume 65 Issue 5, September-October 2017, pp. 1231-1249</p>
<p>We study inventory control of serial supply chains with continuous, Markov-modulated demand (MMD). Our goal is to simplify the computational complexity by resorting to certain approximation techniques, and, in doing so, to gain a deeper understanding of the problem. First, we perform a derivative analysis of the problem’s optimality equations and develop general, analytical solution bounds for the optimal policy. This leads to simple-to-compute near-optimal heuristic solutions, which also reveal an intuitive relationship with the primitive model parameters. Second, we establish an MMD central limit theorem under long replenishment lead time through asymptotic analysis. We show that the relative errors between our heuristic and the optimal solutions converge to zero as the lead time becomes sufficiently long, with the rate of convergence being the square root of the lead time. Third, we show that, by leveraging the Laplace transform, the computational complexity of our heuristic is superior to the existing methods. Finally, we provide the first set of numerical study for serial systems under MMD. The numerical results demonstrate that our heuristic achieves near-optimal performance even under short lead times and outperforms alternative heuristics in the literature. In addition, we observe that, in an optimally run supply chain under MMD, the internal fill rate can be high and the demand variability propagating upstream can be dampened, both different from the system behaviors under stationary demand.<br>The online appendix is available at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1615" target="_blank" rel="external">https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1615</a>.<br>Keywords: multiechelon inventory systems; Markov-modulated demand; derivative; asymptotic analysis</p>

<p>Many seasonal products are transported via ocean carriers from origin to destination markets. The shipments arriving earlier in the market may sell at higher prices, but faster shipping services can be costly. In this paper, we study a newsvendor-type shipper who transports and sells seasonal products to an overseas market, where the selling price declines over time. A set of vessels with different schedules and freight rates are available to choose from. Our analysis demonstrates that a portfolio of vessels has two distinct effects on mitigating uncertainties in both demand and vessels’ arrival schedules, while these two portfolio effects have been previously understood as separate issues in the literature. To find the optimal portfolio in our problem, we first show that when vessels arrive in a deterministic sequence, the optimal portfolio can either be derived in closed form (in the single-demand setting), or computed efficiently with a variation of the shortest-path algorithm (in the multi-demand setting). Then, based on these results, we propose an approximation procedure to address the general problem with an uncertain arrival sequence. In each iteration of the procedure, we only need to minimize a cost function approximated by a deterministic arrival schedule, and the portfolio generated can converge to the optimal one under mild conditions. Finally, we present a real-world case study to demonstrate several practical implications of managing a carrier portfolio.<br>The online appendix is available at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1616" target="_blank" rel="external">https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1616</a>.<br>Keywords: ocean transport; diversification; carrier portfolio; newsvendor problem</p>

<p>We study a practical generalization of the classical stochastic dynamic inventory problem where privately owned trucks with limited cargo capacity are used to transport the replenishment quantity. The resulting replenishment cost function also includes the traditional fixed setup cost, and it is known as a multiple setup cost structure, which leads to complicated cost-to-go functions in the problem of interest. We introduce the concepts of non-(Δ, C)-decreasing and non-(Δ,C)ℕK-decreasing, and we develop a sophisticated replenishment policy called the (Q,s→,S→) policy. We examine the sufficient conditions under which the new policy is optimal. Our results offer a detailed characterization of optimal policies and generalize the existing theory on the concepts of K-convexity and non-K-decreasing. In doing so, we are able to investigate a traditional stochastic inventory problem which has remained open in the literature for more than four decades.<br>The online appendix is available at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1625" target="_blank" rel="external">https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1625</a>.<br>Keywords: stochastic dynamic inventory model; generalized convexity; cargo cost and capacity; multiple setup cost function; non-K-decreasing functions</p>

<p>Technical Note—Optimal Long-Term Supply Contracts with Asymmetric Demand Information<br>Ilan Lobel<br>Stern School of Business, New York University, New York, New York 10012<br>Wenqiang Xiao<br>Stern School of Business, New York University, New York, New York 10012<br>Accepted Online: June 3, 2013<br>Received Online: January 25, 2017<br>Published Online: July 24, 2017<br>Operations Research, Volume 65 Issue 5, September-October 2017, pp. 1275-1284</p>
<p>We consider a manufacturer selling to a retailer with private demand information arising dynamically over an infinite time horizon. Under a backlogging model, we show that the manufacturer’s optimal dynamic long-term contract takes a simple form: in the first period, based on her private demand forecast, the retailer selects a wholesale price and pays an associated upfront fee, and, from then on, the two parties stick to a simple wholesale price contract with the retailer’s chosen price. Under a lost sales model, we show that the structure of the optimal long-term contract combines a menu of wholesale pricing contracts with an option that, if exercised by the retailer, reduces future wholesale prices in exchange for an immediate payment to the manufacturer.<br>The online appendix is available at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1626" target="_blank" rel="external">https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1626</a>.<br>Keywords: dynamic contracting; dynamic mechanism design; inventory control</p>

<p>We study optimal policies for dual-supply inventory systems where a firm commits to buying a total minimum quantity from both supplies or two separate total minimum quantities from each supply over a finite planning horizon. The two supply options differ in their costs and lead times. For the system under the joint commitment, the optimal policy has a simple structure and can be fully characterized by three critical numbers in each period. For the system under the separate commitments, we show that the optimal order quantities in each period are monotonic in the starting inventory and the remaining commitments with bounded sensitivity. Moreover, we establish convergence results on the optimal order quantities when the committed quantity from either supply approaches infinity. These findings highlight the effects of order commitments on the optimal inventory policies. On the basis of these results, we develop a simple heuristic for the system under separate commitments and show numerically that it performs very well. The numerical study further shows that the firm could incur a considerable loss if it ignores or overemphasizes the order commitments when managing its inventory. Finally, we conduct numerical analysis to derive insights into the firm’s supply contract selection in the presence of minimum order commitments.<br>The online appendix is available at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1622" target="_blank" rel="external">https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1622</a>.<br>Keywords: optimal policy; two supply options; total minimum commitment; monotonicity; convergence</p>

<p>Consolidation carriers transport shipments that are small relative to trailer capacity. To be cost effective, the carrier must consolidate shipments, which requires coordinating their paths in both space and time; i.e., the carrier must solve a service network design problem. Most service network design models rely on discretization of time—i.e., instead of determining the exact time at which a dispatch should occur, the model determines a time interval during which a dispatch should occur. While the use of time discretization is widespread in service network design models, a fundamental question related to its use has never been answered: Is it possible to produce an optimal continuous-time solution without explicitly modeling each point in time? We answer this question in the affirmative. We develop an iterative refinement algorithm using partially time-expanded networks that solves continuous-time service network design problems. An extensive computational study demonstrates that the algorithm not only is of theoretical interest but also performs well in practice.<br>Keywords: service network design; time-expanded network; iterative refinement</p>

<p>We consider revenue management problems when customers choose among the offered products according to the Markov chain choice model. In this choice model, a customer arrives into the system to purchase a particular product. If this product is available for purchase, then the customer purchases it. Otherwise, the customer transitions to another product or to the no purchase option, until she reaches an available product or the no purchase option. We consider three classes of problems. First, we study assortment problems, where the goal is to find a set of products to offer to maximize the expected revenue obtained from each customer. We give a linear program to obtain the optimal solution. Second, we study single resource revenue management problems, where the goal is to adjust the set of offered products over a selling horizon when the sale of each product consumes the resource. We show how the optimal set of products to offer changes with the remaining resource inventory. Third, we study network revenue management problems, where the goal is to adjust the set of offered products over a selling horizon when the sale of each product consumes a combination of resources. A standard linear programming approximation of this problem includes one decision variable for each subset of products. We show that this linear program can be reduced to an equivalent one with a substantially smaller size. We give an algorithm to recover the optimal solution to the original linear program from the reduced linear program. The reduced linear program can dramatically improve the solution times for the original linear program.<br>The online appendix, data files, and source code are available at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1628" target="_blank" rel="external">https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1628</a>.<br>Keywords: assortment planning; Markov chain choice model; revenue management</p>

<p>Information Relaxation Bounds for Infinite Horizon Markov Decision Processes<br>David B. Brown<br>Fuqua School of Business, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina 27708<br>Martin B. Haugh<br>Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027<br>Accepted Online: September 4, 2014<br>Received Online: March 30, 2017<br>Published Online: August 02, 2017<br>Operations Research, Volume 65 Issue 5, September-October 2017, pp. 1355-1379</p>
<p>We consider the information relaxation approach for calculating performance bounds for stochastic dynamic programs (DPs), following Brown et al. [Brown DB, Smith JE, Sun P (2010) Information relaxations and duality in stochastic dynamic programs. Oper. Res. 58(4, Part 1):785–801]. This approach generates performance bounds by solving problems with relaxed nonanticipativity constraints and a penalty that punishes violations of these constraints. In this paper, we study infinite horizon DPs with discounted costs and consider applying information relaxations to reformulations of the DP. These reformulations use different state transition functions and correct for the change in state transition probabilities by multiplying by likelihood ratio factors. These reformulations can greatly simplify solutions of the information relaxations, both in leading to finite horizon subproblems and by reducing the number of states that need to be considered in these subproblems. We show that any reformulation leads to a lower bound on the optimal cost of the DP when used with an information relaxation and a penalty built from a broad class of approximate value functions. We refer to this class of approximate value functions as subsolutions, and this includes approximate value functions based on Lagrangian relaxations as well as those based on approximate linear programs. We show that the information relaxation approach, in theory, recovers a tight lower bound using any reformulation and is guaranteed to improve on the lower bounds from subsolutions. Finally, we apply information relaxations to an inventory control application with an autoregressive demand process, as well as dynamic service allocation in a multiclass queue. In our examples, we find that the information relaxation lower bounds are easy to calculate and are very close to the expected cost using simple heuristic policies, thereby showing that these heuristic policies are nearly optimal.<br>Keywords: infinite horizon dynamic programs; information relaxations; Lagrangian relaxations; inventory control; multiclass queues</p>

<p>Refined Models for Efficiency-Driven Queues with Applications to Delay Announcements and Staffing<br>Junfei Huang<br>Department of Decision Sciences and Managerial Economics, CUHK Business School, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong<br>Avishai Mandelbaum<br>Faculty of Industrial Engineering and Management, Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, 3200003 Haifa, Israel<br>Hanqin Zhang<br>Department of Decision Sciences, NUS Business School, National University of Singapore, Singapore<br>Jiheng Zhang<br>Department of Industrial Engineering and Logistics Management, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Hong Kong<br>Accepted Online: June 14, 2014<br>Received Online: January 25, 2017<br>Published Online: July 17, 2017<br>Operations Research, Volume 65 Issue 5, September-October 2017, pp. 1380-1397</p>
<p>Data has revealed a noticeable impact of delay-time-related information on phone-customers; for example and somewhat surprisingly, delay announcements can abruptly increase the likelihood to abandon (hang up). Our starting point is that the latter phenomena can be used to support the control of queue lengths and delays. We do so by timing the announcements appropriately and determining the staffing levels accordingly. To this end, we model a service system as an overloaded GI/M/s + GI queue, in which we seek to minimize the number of servers, s, subject to quality-of-service constraints (e.g., fraction abandoning), while accounting for the instantaneous (hence discontinuous) impact of an announcement on the distribution (hazard rate) of customer patience. For tractability, our analysis is asymptotic as s increases indefinitely, and it is naturally efficiency-driven (namely the servers are highly busy, and hence essentially all customers are delayed in queue prior to service). This requires one to go beyond existing theory, which turns out to be too crude for our needs (e.g., it requires a continuous hazard rate of impatience and hence cannot be applied). We thus develop a refined process and steady-state models, and use them to solve our minimization problem and more. The value and accuracy of our models are demonstrated via extensive numerical experiments.<br>The online appendix is available at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1619" target="_blank" rel="external">https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1619</a>.<br>Keywords: customer abandonment; delay announcement; staffing; call centers; ED+QED; refined approximation</p>

<p>Flexible Queueing Architectures<br>John N.

<p>We study a multiserver model with n flexible servers and n queues, connected through a bipartite graph, where the level of flexibility is captured by an upper bound on the graph’s average degree, dn. Applications in content replication in data centers, skill-based routing in call centers, and flexible supply chains are among our main motivations. We focus on the scaling regime where the system size n tends to infinity, while the overall traffic intensity stays fixed. We show that a large capacity region and an asymptotically vanishing queueing delay are simultaneously achievable even under limited flexibility (dn ≪ n). Our main results demonstrate that, when dn ≫ ln n, a family of expander-graph-based flexibility architectures has a capacity region that is within a constant factor of the maximum possible, while simultaneously ensuring a diminishing queueing delay for all arrival rate vectors in the capacity region. Our analysis is centered around a new class of virtual-queue-based scheduling policies that rely on dynamically constructed job-to-server assignments on the connectivity graph. For comparison, we also analyze a natural family of modular architectures, which is simpler but has provably weaker performance.<br>The online appendix is available at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1620" target="_blank" rel="external">https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1620</a>.<br>Keywords: queueing; flexibility; dynamic matching; resource pooling; expander graph; asymptotics</p>

<p>Closed-Form Approximations for Optimal (r, q) and (S, T) Policies in a Parallel Processing Environment<br>Marcus Ang<br>Lee Kong Chian School of Business, Singapore Management University, 178899, Singapore<br>Karl Sigman<br>Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027<br>Jing-Sheng Song<br>Fuqua School of Business, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina 27708<br>Hanqin Zhang<br>NUS Business School, National University of Singapore, 119245, Singapore<br>Accepted Online: July 28, 2013<br>Received Online: January 25, 2017<br>Published Online: July 19, 2017<br>Operations Research, Volume 65 Issue 5, September-October 2017, pp. 1414-1428</p>
<p>We consider a single-item continuous-review (r, q) inventory system with a renewal demand process and independent, identically distributed stochastic lead times. Using a stationary marked-point process technique and a heavy-traffic limit, we prove a previous conjecture that inventory position and inventory on-order are asymptotically independent. We also establish closed-form expressions for the optimal policy parameters and system cost in heavy-traffic limit, the first of their kind, to our knowledge. These expressions sharpen our understanding of the key determinants of the optimal policy and their quantitative and qualitative impacts. For example, the results demonstrate that the well-known square-root relationship between the optimal order quantity and demand rate under a sequential processing environment is replaced by the cube root under a stochastic parallel processing environment. We further extend the study to periodic-review (S, T) systems with constant lead times.<br>The electronic companion is available at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1623" target="_blank" rel="external">https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1623</a>.<br>Keywords: inventory system; (r, q) policy; i.i.d. lead times; asymptotic analysis; heavy-traffic limit; closed-form solutions</p>

<p>Currently, most Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) markets are defined based on targets that create an artificial step demand function resembling a cliff. This target policy produces volatile prices that can make investing in renewables a risky proposition. In this paper, we propose an alternative policy called Adjustable Dynamic Assignment of Penalties and Targets (ADAPT) that uses a sloped compliance penalty and a self-regulating requirement schedule, both designed to stabilize REC prices, helping to alleviate a common weakness of environmental markets. To capture market behavior, we model the market as a stochastic dynamic programming problem to understand how the market might balance the decision to use a REC now versus holding it for future periods (in the face of uncertain new supply). Then, we present and prove some of the properties of this market, and finally we show that this mechanism reduces the volatility of REC prices, which should stabilize the market and encourage long-term investment in renewables.<br>Keywords: compliance policy; renewable energy certificates; stochastic dynamic programming; price volatility; mechanism design</p>

<p>Efficient Dynamic Barter Exchange<br>Ross Anderson<br>Google, Mountain View, California 94043<br>Itai Ashlagi<br>Management Science and Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305<br>David Gamarnik<br>Sloan School of Management, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139<br>Yash Kanoria<br>Decision, Risk and Operations Division, Columbia Business School, New York, New York 10027<br>Accepted Online: May 20, 2014<br>Received Online: April 17, 2017<br>Published Online: September 14, 2017<br>Operations Research, Volume 65 Issue 6, November-December 2017, pp. 1446-1459</p>
<p>We study dynamic matching policies in a stochastic marketplace for barter, with agents arriving over time. Each agent is endowed with an item and is interested in an item possessed by another agent homogeneously with probability p, independently for all pairs of agents. Three settings are considered with respect to the types of allowed exchanges: (a) only two-way cycles, in which two agents swap items, (b) two-way or three-way cycles, (c) (unbounded) chains initiated by an agent who provides an item but expects nothing in return.<br>We consider the average waiting time as a measure of efficiency and find that the cost outweighs the benefit from waiting to thicken the market. In particular, in each of the above settings, a policy that conducts exchanges in a greedy fashion is near optimal. Further, for small p, we find that allowing three-way cycles greatly reduces the waiting time over just two-way cycles, and conducting exchanges through a chain further reduces the waiting time significantly. Thus, a centralized planner can achieve the smallest waiting times by using a greedy policy, and by facilitating three-way cycles and chains, if possible.<br>The online appendix is available at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1644" target="_blank" rel="external">https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1644</a>.<br>Keywords: barter; matching; market design; random graphs; dynamics; kidney exchange; platform; control policy</p>

<p>We consider the problem of minimizing daily expected resource usage and overtime costs across multiple parallel resources such as anesthesiologists and operating rooms, which are used to conduct a variety of surgical procedures at large multispecialty hospitals. To address this problem, we develop a two-stage, mixed-integer stochastic dynamic programming model with recourse. The first stage allocates these resources across multiple surgeries with uncertain durations and prescribes the sequence of surgeries to these resources. The second stage determines actual start times to surgeries based on realized durations of preceding surgeries and assigns overtime to resources to ensure all surgeries are completed using the allocation and sequence determined in the first stage. We develop a data-driven robust optimization method that solves large-scale real-sized versions of this model close to optimality. We validate and implement this model as a decision support system at the UCLA Ronald Reagan Medical Center. This system effectively incorporates the flexibility in the resources and uncertainty in surgical durations, and explicitly trades off resource usage and overtime costs. This has increased the average daily utilization of the anesthesiologists by 3.5% and of the operating rooms by 3.8%. This has led to an average daily cost savings of around 7% or estimated to be $2.2 million on an annual basis. In addition, the insights based on this model have significantly influenced decision making at the operating services department at this hospital.<br>The e-companion is available at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1634" target="_blank" rel="external">https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1634</a>.<br>Keywords: healthcare operations; mixed integer stochastic dynamic programming; robust optimization</p>

<p>Improving HIV Early Infant Diagnosis Supply Chains in Sub-Saharan Africa: Models and Application to Mozambique<br>Jónas Oddur Jónasson<br>MIT Sloan School of Management, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02142<br>Sarang Deo<br>Indian School of Business, Gachibowli, Hyderabad, India, 50032<br>Jérémie Gallien<br>London Business School, Regent’s Park, London NW1 4SA, United Kingdom<br>Accepted Online: October 17, 2014<br>Received Online: March 31, 2017<br>Published Online: September 20, 2017<br>Operations Research, Volume 65 Issue 6, November-December 2017, pp. 1479-1493</p>
<p>Early diagnosis of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) among infants born to HIV-infected mothers is critical because roughly 50% of untreated infected infants die before the age of two years. Yet most countries in sub-Saharan Africa experience significant delays in diagnosis because of operational inefficiencies in early infant diagnosis (EID) networks. We develop a two-part modeling framework relying on optimization and simulation to generate operational improvements in the assignment of clinics to laboratories and the allocation of capacity across laboratories, and to evaluate the associated impact on the number of infants initiating treatment. Applying our methodology to EID program data from Mozambique, we validate our simulation model and estimate that optimally reassigning clinics to labs would decrease the average sample turnaround time (TAT) by 11% and increase the number of infected infants starting treatment by about 4% relative to the current system. Furthermore, consolidating all diagnostic capacity in one centralized lab would decrease average TATs by an estimated 22% and increase the number of infected infants initiating treatment by 7%. Our sensitivity analysis suggests that the consolidation of capacity in a single location would remain near optimal across a wide range of laboratory utilization levels in Mozambique. However, this full consolidation solution is dominated by configurations with two or more labs for EID networks with average transportation times larger than those currently observed in Mozambique by at least 15%.<br>The online appendix is available at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1646" target="_blank" rel="external">https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1646</a>.<br>Keywords: facility location; queueing networks; supply chain optimization; HIV prevention; early infant diagnosis</p>

<p>We introduce a broad family of generalised self-exciting point processes with CIR-type intensities, and we develop associated algorithms for their exact simulation. The underlying models are extensions of the classical Hawkes process, which already has numerous applications in modelling the arrival of events with clustering or contagion effect in finance, economics, and many other fields. Interestingly, we find that the CIR-type intensity, together with its point process, can be sequentially decomposed into simple random variables, which immediately leads to a very efficient simulation scheme. Our algorithms are also pretty accurate and flexible. They can be easily extended to further incorporate externally excited jumps, or, to a multidimensional framework. Some typical numerical examples and comparisons with other well-known schemes are reported in detail. In addition, a simple application for modelling a portfolio loss process is presented.<br>The online appendix is available at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1640" target="_blank" rel="external">https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1640</a><br>Keywords: contagion risk; jump clustering; stochastic intensity model; self-exciting point process; self-exciting point process with CIR intensity; Hawkes process; CIR process;square-root process; exact simulation; Monte Carlo simulation; portfolio risk</p>

<p>In this paper, we study the relationship between several well known classes of discrete choice models, i.e., the random utility model (RUM), the representative agent model (RAM), and the semiparametric choice model (SCM). Using a welfare-based model as an intermediate, we show that the RAM and the SCM are equivalent. Furthermore, we show that both models as well as the welfare-based model strictly subsume the RUM when there are three or more alternatives, while the four are equivalent when there are only two alternatives. Thus, this paper presents a complete picture of the relationship between these choice models.<br>Keywords: welfare function; random utility model; representative agent model; semiparametric choice model</p>

<p>We consider two-stage sequential decision-making problems where in Stage 1 an initial decision is made under a multivariate uncertainty, and in Stage 2 the uncertainty is resolved, a further decision is made based on the uncertainty realization, and the payoff is observed. We focus on problems where the payoff is a linear function of the multivariate uncertainty realization. Such problems can be written as single-stage nonlinear optimization problems composed of partial polyhedral expectations of the multivariate uncertainty. We identify the structural characteristics of multivariate probability density functions under which the integral expressions for the partial expectations can be directly evaluated for an exact value. We then focus on elliptical distributions, which are frequently used in operations management and do have these characteristics. We develop a sequence of three results to determine partial polyhedral expectations of elliptical probability distributions, with a special emphasis on the normal distribution. These results are useful for solving several commonly faced two-stage problems in operations management for an exact solution, performing a comparative static analysis, and rank ordering the alternatives.<br>The online appendix is available at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1604" target="_blank" rel="external">https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1604</a>.<br>Keywords: two-stage problems; optimization; decision making under uncertainty</p>

<p>Technical Note—Local Bargaining and Supply Chain Instability<br>Thành Nguyen<br>Krannert School of Management, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana 47907<br>Accepted Online: October 12, 2013<br>Received Online: January 15, 2017<br>Published Online: June 08, 2017<br>Operations Research, Volume 65 Issue 6, November-December 2017, pp. 1535-1545</p>
<p>We analyze the behavior of a competitive n-tier supply chain system, where agents bargain with each other locally. We study the influence of transaction costs on the convergence of the system to a stationary outcome. In particular, we consider a dynamic bargaining game among a finite set of agents and its replications, and use a limit stationary equilibrium to examine the system’s behavior as the population’s size goes to infinity. The convergence of the system to a limit stationary equilibrium would capture the common belief that as the market gets large, it converges to a competitive and stable outcome. However, we prove that depending on the underlying transaction costs, the system might not converge to such an equilibrium. Interestingly, our result shows that a small increase in the transaction cost at one end of the chain can be greatly amplified and shifts the system away from the steady state. When a limit stationary equilibrium exists, we show that it is unique. We use such an equilibrium outcome to study trade surplus among sellers, buyers, and middlemen.<br>Keywords: noncooperative bargaining; incentives; supply chains</p>

<p>Optimal Rebate Strategies Under Dynamic Pricing<br>Shanshan Hu<br>School of International Business Administration, Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, Shanghai 200433, China<br>Xing Hu<br>Lundquist College of Business, University of Oregon, Eugene, Oregon 97403<br>Qing Ye<br>School of Economics and Management, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China<br>Accepted Online: July 24, 2015<br>Received Online: March 30, 2017<br>Published Online: September 11, 2017<br>Operations Research, Volume 65 Issue 6, November-December 2017, pp. 1546-1561</p>
<p>Instant discounts and mail-in rebates are two common pricing tools in retail, but they are not simple substitutes. On the one hand, consumers discount the face value of a mail-in rebate, making it less effective than an instant discount in inducing consumers’ purchase. On the other hand, a portion of consumers with mail-in rebates fail to redeem them, resulting in savings for the retailer. We study how retailers, under pressure to move inventory, should use these two pricing tools to maximize revenue by determining the optimal use of mail-in rebates together with dynamic pricing of limited inventory. In a base model that allows frequent adjustment of product price and rebate face value, the optimal policy takes the form of “discount only,” “rebate only,” or a combination of the two. For useful heuristics with infrequent policy adjustment, we analyze the deterministic approximation of the base model. Interestingly, the deterministic solution splits the selling season into two segments, and it suggests using different pricing-rebate policies in each segment. Finally, we study a scenario in which the retailer has only one opportunity to introduce a static rebate, and we find that for any inventory level there is a cutoff time before which rebates should not be used. Our numerical studies show that such an optimal one-time static rebate policy performs well compared with the optimal revenue in the benchmark model.<br>The online appendix is available at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1642" target="_blank" rel="external">https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1642</a>.<br>Keywords: revenue management; dynamic pricing; rebate coupon; heuristics; asymptotic optimality</p>

<p>A NonCooperative Approach to Cost Allocation in Joint Replenishment<br>Simai He<br>School of Information Management and Engineering, Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, Shanghai, China 200433<br>Jay Sethuraman<br>Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027<br>Xuan Wang<br>Department of Information Systems, Business Statistics and Operations Management, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong<br>Jiawei Zhang<br>Leonard N.

<p>We consider the infinite-horizon multiple retailer joint replenishment problem with first-order interaction. In this model, the joint setup cost incurred by a group of retailers placing an order simultaneously consists of a group-independent major setup cost and retailer-specific minor setup costs. The goal is to determine an inventory replenishment policy that minimizes the long-run average system-wide cost. In this paper, we adopt a noncooperative approach to study the joint replenishment game. We consider the allocation rule in which the major setup cost is split equally among the retailers who place an order together, and each retailer pays his own holding and minor setup costs. Given the preannounced allocation rule, each retailer determines his replenishment policy to minimize his own cost anticipating the other retailers’ strategy. We show that a payoff dominant Nash equilibrium exists, and quantify the efficiency loss of the noncooperative outcome relative to the social optimum. Although the worst-case ratio between the best decentralized outcome and the social optimum is O((ln n)1/2), where n is the number of retailers, numerical results suggest that the best equilibrium is near optimal.<br>The online appendix is available at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1645" target="_blank" rel="external">https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1645</a>.<br>Keywords: joint replenishment; cost-sharing game; payoff dominant Nash equilibrium; price of anarchy; price of stability</p>

<p>Exploiting Big Data in Logistics Risk Assessment via Bayesian Nonparametrics<br>Yan Shang<br>Facebook, Inc., Menlo Park, California 94025<br>David Dunson<br>Department of Statistical Science, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina 27710<br>Jing-Sheng Song<br>Fuqua School of Business, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina 27708<br>Accepted Online: December 17, 2014<br>Received Online: December 15, 2016<br>Published Online: June 23, 2017<br>Operations Research, Volume 65 Issue 6, November-December 2017, pp. 1574-1588</p>
<p>In cargo logistics, a key performance measure is transport risk, defined as the deviation of the actual arrival time from the planned arrival time. Neither earliness nor tardiness is desirable for customer and freight forwarders. In this paper, we investigate ways to assess and forecast transport risks using a half-year of air cargo data, provided by a leading forwarder on 1,336 routes served by 20 airlines. Interestingly, our preliminary data analysis shows a strong multimodal feature in the transport risks, driven by unobserved events, such as cargo missing flights. To accommodate this feature, we introduce a Bayesian nonparametric model—the probit stick-breaking process mixture model—for flexible estimation of the conditional (i.e., state-dependent) density function of transport risk. We demonstrate that using alternative methods can lead to misleading inferences. Our model provides a tool for the forwarder to offer customized price and service quotes. It can also generate baseline airline performance to enable fair supplier evaluation. Furthermore, the method allows us to separate recurrent risks from disruption risks. This is important, because hedging strategies for these two kinds of risks are often drastically different.<br>The online appendix is available at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1612" target="_blank" rel="external">https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1612</a>.<br>Keywords: Bayesian statistics; big data; disruptions and risks; empirical; international air cargo logistics; nonparametric; probit stick-breaking mixture model</p>

<p>We consider a random knockout tournament among players 1,…, n, in which each match involves two players. The match format is specified by the number of matches played in each round, where the constitution of the matches in a round is random. Supposing that there are numbers v1,…, vn such that a match between i and j will be won by i with probability vi/(vi + vj), we obtain a lower bound on the tournament win probability for the best player, as well as upper and lower bounds for all of the players. We also obtain additional bounds by considering the best and worst formats for player 1 in the special case v1 &gt; v2 = v3 = … = vn.<br>Keywords: games/group decisions; stochastic model applications; probability; sequential decision analysis</p>

<p>Non-Elementary Formulations for Single Vehicle Routing Problems with Pickups and Deliveries<br>Bruno P. Bruck<br>Department of Sciences and Methods for Engineering, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, 42122 Reggio Emilia, Italy<br>Manuel Iori<br>Department of Sciences and Methods for Engineering, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, 42122 Reggio Emilia, Italy<br>Accepted Online: November 1, 2014<br>Received Online: March 31, 2017<br>Published Online: September 08, 2017<br>Operations Research, Volume 65 Issue 6, November-December 2017, pp. 1597-1614</p>
<p>We study the class of one-to-many-to-one single vehicle routing problems with pickups and deliveries, in which a single capacitated vehicle is used to serve a set of customers requiring a delivery, a pickup, or both. These problems have many real-world applications, including beverage distribution, courier service transportation, and reverse logistics. We first concentrate on a well-studied problem in this class, known as the single vehicle routing problem with deliveries and selective pickups (SVRPDSP), in which deliveries are mandatory but pickups are optional and generate a revenue if performed, and customers requiring both a delivery and a pickup (combined demand) can be visited either once or twice.<br>Most exact algorithms in the literature solve SVRPDSP by looking for elementary tours on an extended network that is obtained by transforming each combined demand customer into two different customers, one requiring only the delivery and the other one only the pickup. Because this can result in a significant loss in performance, in this work we focus instead on the original problem network and present formulations that can yield non-elementary tours. Through the use of Benders decomposition, valid inequalities, and tailored optimization techniques based on branch-and-cut frameworks, we develop exact algorithms that outmatch previous results in the literature and obtain proven optimal solutions for all benchmark instances. We then generalize the algorithms to solve several other vehicle routing problems with pickups and deliveries, including the cases of split deliveries, intermediate drop-offs, mandatory pickups, and multiple vehicles.<br>The online appendix is available at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1639" target="_blank" rel="external">https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1639</a>.<br>Keywords: pickup and delivery; one-to-many-to-one; selective pickups; valid inequalities; branch-and-cut</p>

<p>Bilevel optimization problems are very challenging optimization models arising in many important practical contexts, including pricing mechanisms in the energy sector, airline and telecommunication industry, transportation networks, critical infrastructure defense, and machine learning. In this paper, we consider bilevel programs with continuous and discrete variables at both levels, with linear objectives and constraints (continuous upper level variables, if any, must not appear in the lower level problem). We propose a general-purpose branch-and-cut exact solution method based on several new classes of valid inequalities, which also exploits a very effective bilevel-specific preprocessing procedure. An extensive computational study is presented to evaluate the performance of various solution methods on a common testbed of more than 800 instances from the literature and 60 randomly generated instances. Our new algorithm consistently outperforms (often by a large margin) alternative state-of-the-art methods from the literature, including methods exploiting problem-specific information for special instance classes. In particular, it solves to optimality more than 300 previously unsolved instances from the literature. To foster research on this challenging topic, our solver is made publicly available online.<br>The online appendix is available at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1650" target="_blank" rel="external">https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1650</a>.<br>Keywords: bilevel optimization; mixed-integer programming; cutting planes; intersection cuts; branch and cut; computational analysis</p>

<p>Integer Programming Approaches for Appointment Scheduling with Random No-Shows and Service Durations<br>Ruiwei Jiang<br>Department of Industrial and Operations Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109<br>Siqian Shen<br>Department of Industrial and Operations Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109<br>Yiling Zhang<br>Department of Industrial and Operations Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109<br>Accepted Online: December 4, 2015<br>Received Online: May 3, 2017<br>Published Online: October 09, 2017<br>Operations Research, Volume 65 Issue 6, November-December 2017, pp. 1638-1656</p>
<p>We consider a single-server scheduling problem given a fixed sequence of appointment arrivals with random no-shows and service durations. The probability distribution of the uncertain parameters is assumed to be ambiguous, and only the support and first moments are known. We formulate a class of distributionally robust (DR) optimization models that incorporate the worst-case expectation/conditional value-at-risk penalty cost of appointment waiting, server idleness, and overtime into the objective or constraints. Our models flexibly adapt to different prior beliefs of no-show uncertainty. We obtain exact mixed-integer nonlinear programming reformulations and derive valid inequalities to strengthen the reformulations that are solved by decomposition algorithms. In particular, we derive convex hulls for special cases of no-show beliefs, yielding polynomial-sized linear programming models for the least and the most conservative supports of no-shows. We test various instances to demonstrate the computational efficacy of our approaches and to compare the results of various DR models given perfect or ambiguous distributional information.<br>The e-companion is available at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1656" target="_blank" rel="external">https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1656</a>.<br>Keywords: appointment scheduling; no-show uncertainty; distributionally robust optimization; mixed-integer programming; valid inequalities; totally unimodularity; convex hulls</p>

<p>This paper addresses one-machine scheduling with maintenance restrictions. A maintenance operation is position dependent in a sequence of normal jobs if the maintenance has to be performed after at most some defined number of job changes on the machine. We show that several problems with objective functions Cmax and Lmax are still solvable in polynomial time if position-dependent maintenance is considered. We then consider the problem of preemptive scheduling with ready times and due dates on one machine with the Lmax criterion. We show that this problem is computationally hard and present the characteristics of this problem—for example, the fact that optimum schedules may be nonactive. After determining a set of dominance properties, branch-and-bound and local search algorithms are proposed. The performance of the algorithms is evaluated using a series of computational experiments.<br>Keywords: maintenance scheduling; position-dependent maintenance</p>

<p>Quantiles are often used to measure risk of stochastic systems. We examine quantile estimators obtained using simulation with Latin hypercube sampling (LHS), a variance-reduction technique that efficiently extends stratified sampling to higher dimensions and produces negatively correlated outputs. We consider single-sample LHS (ssLHS), which minimizes the variance that can be obtained from LHS, and also replicated LHS (rLHS). We develop a consistent estimator of the asymptotic variance of the ssLHS quantile estimator’s central limit theorem, enabling us to provide the first confidence interval (CI) for a quantile when applying ssLHS. For rLHS, we construct CIs using batching and sectioning. On average, our rLHS CIs are shorter than previous rLHS CIs and only slightly wider than the ssLHS CI. We establish the asymptotic validity of the CIs by first proving that the quantile estimators satisfy Bahadur representations, which show that the quantile estimators can be approximated by linear transformations of estimators of the cumulative distribution function. We present numerical results comparing the various CIs.<br>Keywords: simulation; efficiency; statistical analysis; reliability; system safety</p>

<p>Tail Analysis Without Parametric Models: A Worst-Case Perspective<br>Henry Lam<br>Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027<br>Clementine Mottet<br>Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts 02215<br>Accepted Online: April 29, 2015<br>Received Online: March 31, 2017<br>Published Online: September 25, 2017<br>Operations Research, Volume 65 Issue 6, November-December 2017, pp. 1696-1711</p>
<p>A common bottleneck in evaluating extremal performance measures is that, because of their very nature, tail data are often very limited. The conventional approach selects the best probability distribution from tail data using parametric fitting, but the validity of the parametric choice can be difficult to verify. This paper describes an alternative based on the computation of worst-case bounds under the geometric premise of tail convexity, a feature shared by all common parametric tail distributions. We characterize the optimality structure of the resulting optimization problem, and demonstrate that the worst-case convex tail behavior is in a sense either extremely light tailed or extremely heavy tailed. We develop low-dimensional nonlinear programs that distinguish between the two cases and compute the worst-case bound. We numerically illustrate how the proposed approach can give more reliable performances than conventional parametric methods.<br>The online appendix is available at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1643" target="_blank" rel="external">https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1643</a>.<br>Keywords: tail modeling; robust analysis; nonparametric</p>

<p>In 1964, Kleinrock proposed a queueing discipline for a single-server queue in which customers from different classes accumulate priority as linear functions of their waiting time. At the instant that a server becomes free, it selects the waiting customer with the highest accumulated priority, provided that the queue is nonempty. He developed a recursion for calculating the expected waiting time for each class. In 2014, Stanford, Taylor, and Ziedins reconsidered this queue, which they termed the accumulating priority queue (APQ), and derived the waiting time distribution for each class. Kleinrock and Finkelstein in 1967 also studied an accumulating priority system in which customers’ priorities increase as a power-law function of their waiting time. They established that it is possible to associate a particular linear APQ with such a power-law APQ, so that the expected waiting times of customers from all classes are preserved. In this paper, we extend their analysis to characterise the class of nonlinear APQs for which an equivalent linear APQ can be found, in the sense that, for identical sample paths of the arrival and service processes, the ordering of all customers is identical at all times in both the linear and nonlinear systems.<br>Keywords: key performance indicator; linear proxy; waiting times</p>

<p>Technical Note—Dynamic Pricing and Demand Learning with Limited Price Experimentation<br>Wang Chi Cheung<br>Institute of High Performance Computing, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore 138632<br>David Simchi-Levi<br>Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, MIT Institute for Data, Systems, and Society, Operations Research Center, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139<br>He Wang<br>School of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia 30332<br>Accepted Online: September 21, 2015<br>Received Online: March 28, 2017<br>Published Online: August 02, 2017<br>Operations Research, Volume 65 Issue 6, November-December 2017, pp. 1722-1731</p>
<p>In a dynamic pricing problem where the demand function is not known a priori, price experimentation can be used as a demand learning tool. Existing literature usually assumes no constraint on price changes, but in practice, sellers often face business constraints that prevent them from conducting extensive experimentation. We consider a dynamic pricing model where the demand function is unknown but belongs to a known finite set. The seller is allowed to make at most m price changes during T periods. The objective is to minimize the worst-case regret—i.e., the expected total revenue loss compared with a clairvoyant who knows the demand distribution in advance. We demonstrate a pricing policy that incurs a regret of O(log(m) T), or m iterations of the logarithm. Furthermore, we describe an implementation of this pricing policy at Groupon, a large e-commerce marketplace for daily deals. The field study shows significant impact on revenue and bookings.<br>The e-companion is available at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1629" target="_blank" rel="external">https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1629</a>.<br>Keywords: revenue management; dynamic pricing; learning–earning trade-off; price experimentation</p>
